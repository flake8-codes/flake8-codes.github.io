title: 'Found too many raises in a function: {0}'
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids too many `` `raise `` statements in a function.

  - Reasoning:  
    Too many `` `raise `` statements in a function make the code
    untraceable and overcomplicated.

  - Solution:  
    Split the function into smaller functions, such that each of them
    can raise less errors. Create more standard errors, or use
    alternative ways to raise them.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `` `--max-raises ``. Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_RAISES') }}
