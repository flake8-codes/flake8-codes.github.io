title: Found incorrectly swapped variables
---


Forbid unpythonic variable swaps.

We check for ``a = b; b = a`` sequences.

Reasoning:
    This looks like a failed attempt to swap.

Solution:
    Use standard way to swap two variables.

Example::

    # Correct:
    a, b = b, a

    # Wrong:
    a = b
    b = a

    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
