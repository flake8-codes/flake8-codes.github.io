Forbid unreachable code.

What is unreachable code? It is some lines of code that cannot be
executed by python's interpreter.

This is probably caused by `return` or `raise` statements. However, we
cannot cover 100% of truly unreachable code by this rule. This happens
due to the dynamic nature of python. For example, detecting that `1 /
some_value` would sometimes raise an exception is too complicated and is
out of the scope of this rule.

  - Reasoning:  
    Having dead code in your project is an indicator that you do not
    care about your codebase at all. It dramatically reduces code
    quality and readability. It also demotivates team members.

  - Solution:  
    Delete any unreachable code you have or refactor it, if this happens
    by your mistake.

Example:

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        print('This line is reachable, all good')
        return 5
    
    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        return 5
        print('This line is unreachable')
