{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid placing too many `await` expressions in a function.

  - Reasoning:  
    When there are too many `await` keywords, functions are starting to
    get really complex. It is hard to tell where we are and what is
    going on.

  - Solution:  
    Change your design. Split functions into smaller ones.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-awaits`. Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_AWAITS') }}
