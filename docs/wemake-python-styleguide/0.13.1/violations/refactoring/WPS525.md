title: Found wrong "in" compare with single item container
---

Forbids comparisons where `in` is compared with single item container.

## Reasoning
`in` comparison with a container which contains only one item looks
like overhead and unneeded complexity.

## Solution
Refactor your code to use `==` instead `in`.

## Example

    # Correct:
    a == 's'
    
    # Wrong:
    a in {'s'}
