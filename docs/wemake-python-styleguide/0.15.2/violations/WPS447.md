Forbid using the alphabet as a string.

  - Reasoning:  
    Some constants are already defined. No need to write to them again,
    use existing values. We just compare strings and raise this
    violation when they have the same chars.

  - Solution:  
    Use pre-defined constants.

Example:

    # Correct:
    import string
    UPPERCASE_ALPH = string.ascii_uppercase
    LOWERCASE_ALPH = string.ascii_lowercase
    
    # Wrong:
    GUESS_MY_NAME = "abcde...WXYZ"
    UPPERCASE_ALPH = "ABCD...WXYZ"
    LOWERCASE_ALPH = "abcd...wxyz"
