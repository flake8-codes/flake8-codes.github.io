title: 'Found name reserved for first argument: _'

Forbid naming variables `self`, `cls`, or `mcs`.

  - Reasoning:  
    These names are special, they should only be used as first arguments
    inside methods.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class Test(object):
        def __init__(self):
            ...
    
    # Wrong:
    cls = 5
    lambda self: self + 12

This rule checks: functions and methods. Having any reserved names in
`lambda` functions is not allowed.
