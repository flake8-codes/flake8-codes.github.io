Forbids to use extra indentation.

## Reasoning
You can use extra indentation for lines of code. Python allows you
to do that in case you will keep the indentation level equal for
this specific node. But, that's insane\!

## Solution
We should stick to 4 spaces for an indentation block. Each next
block should be indented by just 4 extra spaces.

## Example

    # Correct:
    def test():
        print('test')
    
    # Wrong:
    def test():
                print('test')
