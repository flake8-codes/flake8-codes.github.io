{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid calling some built-in functions.

  - Reasoning:  
    Some functions are only suitable for very specific use cases, we
    forbid the use of them in a free manner.

See :py`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.FUNCTIONS_BLACKLIST` for the
full list of blacklisted functions.
