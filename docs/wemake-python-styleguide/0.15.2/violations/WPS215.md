Restrict the maximum number of base classes.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is almost never possible to navigate to the desired method of a
    parent class when you need it with multiple mixins. It is hard to
    understand `mro` and `super` calls. Do not overuse this technique.

  - Solution:  
    Reduce the number of base classes. Use composition over inheritance.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class SomeClassName(First, Second, Mixin): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class SomeClassName(
        FirstParentClass,
        SecondParentClass,
        ThirdParentClass,
        CustomClass,
        AddedClass,
     ): ...

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-base-classes`. Default:
    `wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_BASE_CLASSES`
