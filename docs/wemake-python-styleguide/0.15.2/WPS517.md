title: Found pointless starred expression
---


Forbid useless starred expressions.

Reasoning:
    Using starred expression with constants is useless.
    This piece of code can be rewritten to be flat.
    Eg.: ``print(*[1, 2, 3])`` is ``print(1, 2, 3)``.

Solution:
    Refactor your code not to use starred expressions
    with ``list``, ``dict``, ``tuple``, and ``set`` constants.
    Use regular argument passing instead.

!!! Example
    ```python
        # Correct:
        my_list = [1, 2, 3, *other_iterable]
    
        # Wrong:
        print(*[1, 2, 3], **{{}})
    ```
{% endraw %}
