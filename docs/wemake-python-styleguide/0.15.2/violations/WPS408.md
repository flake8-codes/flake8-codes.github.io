title: Found duplicate logical condition
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid using the same logical conditions in one expression.

Reasoning: Using the same name in a logical condition more than once
indicates that you are either making a logical mistake, or just
over-complicating your design.

Solution: Remove the duplicated condition.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if some_value or other_value:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if some_value or some_value:
        ...
