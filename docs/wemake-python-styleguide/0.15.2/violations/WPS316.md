title: Found context manager with too many assignments
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid multiple assignment targets for context managers.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is hard to distinguish whether `as` should unpack into a tuple or
    if we are just using two context managers.

  - Solution:  
    Use several context managers or explicit brackets.

Example:

    # Correct:
    with open('') as first:
        with second:
            ...
    
    with some_context as (first, second):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    with open('') as first, second:
        ...
