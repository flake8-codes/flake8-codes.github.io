Forbid underscores (`_`) in numbers.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is possible to write `1000` in three different ways: `1_000`,
    `10_00`, and `100_0`. And it would be still the same number. Count
    how many ways there are to write bigger numbers. Currently, it all
    depends on the cultural habits of the author. We enforce a single
    way to write numbers: without the underscore.

  - Solution:  
    Numbers should be written as numbers: `1000`. If you have a very big
    number with a lot of zeros, use multiplication.

Example:

    # Correct:
    phone = 88313443
    million = 1000000
    
    # Wrong:
    phone = 8_83_134_43
    million = 100_00_00
