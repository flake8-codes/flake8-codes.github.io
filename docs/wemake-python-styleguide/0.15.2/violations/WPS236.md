title: 'Found too many variables used to unpack a tuple: {0}'
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid using too many variables to unpack a tuple.

  - Reasoning:  
    The order and meaning are hard to remember.

  - Solution:  
    If you have more than 2 values in a tuple, consider using
    `` `typing.NamedTuple `` or a dataclass instead.

Example:

    # Correct:
    result = foo()
    
    # Wrong:
    a, b, c, d, e = foo()

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `` `--max-tuple-unpack-length ``.
    Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_TUPLE_UNPACK_LENGTH') }}
