Forbid overused expressions in a module, function or method.

What do we call an "overused expression"? When you use any expression
(like `user_dict['age']` for example) inside your code, you always have
to track that you are not using it "too much" because if that expression
is everywhere inside your code, it is a sign of a problem. It means that
you are missing an abstraction.

We check for overused expressions on two levels:

  - per each function
  - per all module

Related to {{ macros.wps_violation('TooManyExpressionsViolation') }}.

Reasoning: Overusing expressions leads to losing the parts that can and
should be refactored into variables, methods, and properties of objects.

Solution: Refactor expressions to be an attribute, a method, or a new
variable.

Configuration: This rule is configurable with
`--max-module-expressions`. Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_MODULE_EXPRESSIONS') }}

    And with ``--max-function-expressions``.
    Default:
    `{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_FUNCTION_EXPRESSIONS') }}`
