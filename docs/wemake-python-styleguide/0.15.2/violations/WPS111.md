{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid short variable or module names.

Reasoning: It is hard to understand what the variable means and why it
is used, if its name is too short.

Solution: Think of another name. Give more context to it.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, methods,
and classes.

We do not count trailing and leading underscores when calculating
length.

Example::

    # Correct:
    x_coordinate = 1
    abscissa = 2
    
    # Wrong:
    x = 1
    y = 2

Configuration: This rule is configurable with `--min-name-length`.
Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MIN_NAME_LENGTH') }}
