title: Found explicit zero division
---

Forbid explicit division (or modulo) by zero.

## Reasoning
This will just throw `ZeroDivisionError`. If that's what you need:
just throw it. No need to use undefined math behaviours. Or it might
be just a typo / mistake, then fix it.

## Solution
Use `ZeroDivisionError` or make your number something besides `0`.

Example:

    # Correct:
    raise ZeroDivisionError()
    
    # Wrong:
    1 / 0
    1 % 0
