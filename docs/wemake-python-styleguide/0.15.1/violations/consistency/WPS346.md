title: Found wrong operation sign

Forbid double minus operations.

## Reasoning
Having two operations is harder than having just one. Two negations
are harder than one positive expression. Two negations equal to one
positive expression. Positive and negative equal to one negative.

## Solution
Replace double minus operation to a single one with plus. Replace
'plus-minus' operation to a single one with minus.

## Example

    # Correct:
    number = 3 + 1
    number += 6
    number -= 2
    
    # Wrong:
    number = 3 - -1
    number -= -6
    number += -2
