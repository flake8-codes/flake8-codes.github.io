Forbid variable or module names which shadow builtin names.

  - Reasoning:  
    Your code simply breaks Python. After you create `list = 1`, you
    cannot not call `builtin` function `list` and what can be worse than
    that?

  - Solution:  
    Rename your entity to not shadow Python builtins.

Example:

    # Correct:
    my_list = list(some_other)
    
    # Wrong:
    str = ''
    list = [1, 2, 3]

This can also cause problems when defining class attributes, for
example:

    class A:
        min = 5
        max = min(10, 20)  # TypeError: 'int' object is not callable

If you feel it is still necessary to use such a class attribute,
consider using a <span class="title-ref">\`noqa</span> comment with
caution.

See :py`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.BUILTINS_WHITELIST` for full
list of builtins we allow to shadow.
