Forbid nested classes.

  - Reasoning:  
    Nested classes are really hard to manage. You cannot even create an
    instance of this class in many cases. Testing them is also really
    hard.

  - Solution:  
    Just write flat classes, there's no need to nest them. If you are
    nesting classes inside a function for parametrization, then you will
    probably need to use a different design (or metaclasses).

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--nested-classes-whitelist`.
    Default:
    `python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.NESTED_CLASSES_WHITELIST`

Example:

    # Correct:
    class Some(object): ...
    class Other(object): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Some(object):
        class Inner(object):
            ...
