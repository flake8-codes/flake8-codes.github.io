title: Found a getter without a return value
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids to have functions starting with `` `get_ `` without returning a
value.

Applies to both methods and functions.

  - Reasoning:  
    A `` `get_ `` function is generally expected to return a value.
    Otherwise, it is most likely either an error or bad naming.

  - Solution:  
    Make sure getter functions `` `return `` or `` `yield `` a value on
    all execution paths, or rename the function.

Example:

    # Correct:
    def get_random_number():
         return random.randint(1, 10)
    
    # Wrong:
    def get_random_number():
         print('I do not return a value!')
