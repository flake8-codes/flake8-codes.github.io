title: Found a float zero (0.0)

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid using float zeros: `` `0.0 ``.

  - Reasoning:  
    Float zeros can be used as variable values which may lead to typing
    bugs when trying to perform an operation between an int number and
    the float zero.

  - Solution:  
    Use int zeros (0). If a float is needed, it should be cast
    explicitly.

Example:

    # Correct:
    zero = 0
    
    # Wrong:
    zero = 0.0
