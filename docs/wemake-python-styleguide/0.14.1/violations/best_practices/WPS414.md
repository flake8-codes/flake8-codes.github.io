title: Found incorrect unpacking target
---

Forbids to have tuple unpacking with side-effects.

## Reasoning
Having unpacking with side-effects is very dirty. You might get in
serious and very hard-to-debug troubles because of this technique.
So, do not use it.

## Solution
Use unpacking with only variables, not any other entities.

## Example

    # Correct:
    first, second = some()
    
    # Wrong:
    first, some_dict['alias'] = some()
