title: Found descriptor applied on a function
---

Forbids descriptors in regular functions.

Forbids using <span class="title-ref">@staticmethod</span>,
`@classmethod` and `@property` for functions not in class.

  - Reasoning:  
    Descriptors like @staticmethod, @classmethod and @property do magic
    only as methods. We would want to warn users if the descriptors are
    used on regular functions.

  - Solution:  
    Do not use @staticmethod, @classmethod and @property on regular
    functions or wrap the functions into a Class.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class TestClass(object):
        @property
        def my_method():
            ...
    
    # Wrong:
    @property
    def my_function():
        ...
