title: 'Found too many expressions: _'
---

Forbids putting too many expressions in a unit of code.

## Reasoning
When there are too many expressions it means that this specific
function does too many things at once. It has too much logic.

## Solution
Split function into several functions, refactor your API.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-expressions`. Default:
`MAX_EXPRESSIONS`
