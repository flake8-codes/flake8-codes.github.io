Forbid mutable constants on a module level.

Reasoning: Constants should be immutable.

Solution: Use immutable types for constants.

We only treat `ast.Set`, `ast.Dict`, `ast.List` and comprehensions as
mutable things. All other nodes are still fine.

Example::

    # Correct:
    import types
    CONST1 = frozenset((1, 2, 3))
    CONST2 = (1, 2, 3)
    CONST3 = types.MappingProxyType({'key': 'value'})
    
    # Wrong:
    CONST1 = {1, 2, 3}
    CONST2 = [x for x in some()]
    CONST3 = {'key': 'value'}
