Forbid some `python` keywords.

  - Reasoning:  
    Using some keywords generally causes more pain than it relieves.
    
    `del` keyword is not composable with other functions, you cannot
    pass it as a regular function. It is also quite error-prone due to
    `__del__` magic method complexity and that `del` is actually used to
    nullify variables and delete them from the execution scope.
    Moreover, it has a lot of substitutions. You won't miss it\!
    
    `pass` keyword is just useless by design. There's no use-case for
    it. Because it does literally nothing.
    
    `global` and `nonlocal` promote bad-practices of having an external
    mutable state somewhere. This solution does not scale and leads to
    multiple possible mistakes in the future.

  - Solution:  
    Solutions differ from keyword to keyword. `pass` should be replaced
    with docstring or `contextlib.suppress`. `del` should be replaced
    with specialized methods like `.pop()`. `global` and `nonlocal`
    usages should be refactored.
