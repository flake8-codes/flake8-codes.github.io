title: Found break or continue in finally block
---

Forbids to use `break` and `continue` in `finally` case.

Related to {{ wps.violation('TryExceptMultipleReturnPathViolation', page) }}.

## Reasoning
Putting any control statements in ``finally` is a terrible practice,
because``finally\` is implicitly called and can cause damage to your
logic with its implicitness. We should not allow it.

## Solution
Remove `break` and `continue` from `finally` blocks.

## Example

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        break
    
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        continue
