Forbid multiple `isinstance` calls on the same variable.

## Reasoning
The best practice is to use `isinstance` with tuple as the second
argument, instead of multiple conditions joined with `or`.

## Solution
Use tuple of types as the second argument.

## Example

    # Correct:
    isinstance(some, (int, float))
    
    # Wrong:
    isinstance(some, int) or isinstance(some, float)
