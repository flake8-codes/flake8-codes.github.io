title: Found incorrect node inside class body
---

Forbids to use incorrect nodes inside `class` definitions.

## Reasoning
Python allows us to have conditions, context managers, and even
infinite loops inside `class` definitions. On the other hand, only
methods, attributes, and docstrings make sense. So, we discourage
using anything except these nodes in class bodies.

## Solution
If you have complex logic inside your class definition, most likely
that you do something wrong. There are different options to refactor
this mess. You can try metaclasses, decorators, builders, and other
patterns.

## Example

    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        for _ in range(10):
            print('What?!')

We also allow some nested classes, check out `NestedClassViolation` for
