Enforce separation of parenthesis from keywords with spaces.

Reasoning:
    Some people use ``return`` and ``yield`` keywords as functions.
    The same happened to good old ``print`` in Python2.

Solution:
    Insert space symbol between the keyword and opening parenthesis.

Example::

    # Wrong:
    def func():
        a = 1
        b = 2
        del(a, b)
        yield(1, 2, 3)

    # Correct:
    def func():
        a = 1
        del (a, b)
        yield (1, 2, 3)
