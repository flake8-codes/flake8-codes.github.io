internalName: ShebangViolation
title: 'Found executable mismatch: _'
---

Forbid executing a file with shebang incorrectly set.

  - A violation is raised in these cases :
    
      - Shebang is present but the file is not executable.
      - The file is executable but no shebang is present.
      - Shebang is present but does not contain "python".
      - Whitespace is present before the shebang.
      - Presence of blank lines or commented lines before the shebang.

## Reasoning
Setting the shebang incorrectly causes an executable mismatch.

## Solution
Ensure that the shebang is present on the first line, and contains
"python", and there is no leading whitespace.

## Example

    # Correct:
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    # Wrong:
    #!/usr/bin/env
        #!/usr/bin/env python
