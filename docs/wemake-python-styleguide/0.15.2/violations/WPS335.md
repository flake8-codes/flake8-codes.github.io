title: Found incorrect `for` loop iter type
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid wrong `for` loop iter targets.

We forbid to use:

  - Lists and list comprehensions
  - Sets and set comprehensions
  - Dicts and dict comprehensions
  - Generator expressions
  - Empty tuples

<!-- end list -->

  - Reasoning:  
    Using lists, dicts, and sets do not make much sense. You can use
    tuples instead. Using comprehensions implicitly creates a two level
    loop, that is hard to read and deal with.

  - Solution:  
    Use tuples to create explicit iterables for `for` loops. In case you
    are using a comprehension, create a new variable.

Example:

    # Correct:
    for person in ('Kim', 'Nick'):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for person in ['Kim', 'Nick']:
        ...
