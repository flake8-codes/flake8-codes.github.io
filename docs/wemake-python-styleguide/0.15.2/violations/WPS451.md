code: 451
title: Found positional-only argument
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid positional only or `/` arguments.

This violation is only raised for `python3.8+`, earlier versions do not
have this concept.

  - Reasoning:  
    This is a very rare case. Almost exclusively used by C code and
    stdlib. There's no point in declaring your own parameters as
    positional only. It will break your code\!

  - Solution:  
    Use regular arguments. In case you are working with C, then this
    violation can be ignored.

Example:

    # Correct:
    def my_function(first, second):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    def my_function(first, /, second):
        ...
