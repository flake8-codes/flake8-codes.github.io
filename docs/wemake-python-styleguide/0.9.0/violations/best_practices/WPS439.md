title: Found yield inside __init__ method
---

Forbids to use `yield` inside of `__init__` method.

## Reasoning
`__init__` should be used to initialize new objects. It shouldn't
`yield` anything because it should return `None` by the convention.

## Example

    # Correct:

>   - class Example(object):
>     
>       - def \_\_init\_\_(self):  
>         self.\_public\_items\_count = 0
> 
> \# Wrong: class Example(object): def \_\_init\_\_(self): yield 10
