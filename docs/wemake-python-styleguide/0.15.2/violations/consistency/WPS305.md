title: Found f string

Forbid `f` strings.

  - Reasoning:  
    `f` strings implicitly rely on the context around them. Imagine that
    you have a string that breaks when you move it two lines above.
    That's not how a string should behave. Also, they promote a bad
    practice: putting your logic inside the template. Moreover, they do
    two things at once: declare a template and format it in a single
    action.

  - Solution:  
    Use `.format()` with indexed params instead.

Example:

    # Wrong:
    f'Result is: {2 + 2}'
    
    # Correct:
    'Result is: {0}'.format(2 + 2)
    'Hey {user}! How are you?'.format(user='sobolevn')
