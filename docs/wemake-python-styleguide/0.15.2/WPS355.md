title: Found an unnecessary blank line before a bracket
---


Forbid useless blank lines before and after brackets.

Reasoning:
    We do this for consistency.

Solution:
    Remove blank lines from the start and from the end of a collection.

Example::

    # Correct:
    arr = [
        1,
        2,
    ]

    # Wrong:
    arr = [

        1,
        2,

    ]
