Forbid nested functions.

## Reasoning
Nesting functions is bad practice. It is hard to test them and it is
hard to separate them later. People tend to overuse closures, so
it's hard to manage the dataflow.

## Solution
Just write flat functions, there's no need to nest them. Pass
parameters as normal arguments, do not use closures until you need
them for decorators or factories.

We also forbid nesting `lambda` and `async` functions.

See {{ wps.constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.NESTED_FUNCTIONS_WHITELIST') }}
for the whole list of whitelisted names.

## Example

    # Correct:
    def do_some(): ...
    def other(): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    def do_some():
        def inner():
            ...
