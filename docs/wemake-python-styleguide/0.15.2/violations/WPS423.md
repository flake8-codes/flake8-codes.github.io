title: Found raise NotImplemented
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `` `NotImplemented `` exception.

  - Reasoning:  
    `` `NotImplemented `` and `` `NotImplementedError `` look similar
    but they have different use cases. Use cases of
    `` `NotImplemented `` are too limited to be generally available.

  - Solution:  
    Use `` `NotImplementedError ``.

Example:

    # Correct:
    raise NotImplementedError('To be done')
    
    # Wrong:
    raise NotImplemented
