title: Found else in for loop without break
---

Forbids to use `else` without `break` in `for` loop.

## Reasoning
When there's no `break` keyword in `for` body it means that `else`
will always be called. This rule will reduce complexity, improve
readability, and protect from possible errors.

## Solution
Refactor your `else` case logic to be inside the `for` body.

## Example

    # Correct:
    for letter in 'abc':
        if letter == 'b':
            break
    else:
        print('"b" is not found')
    
    for letter in 'abc':
        print(letter)
    print('always called')
    
    # Wrong:
    for letter in 'abc':
        print(letter)
    else:
        print('always called')
