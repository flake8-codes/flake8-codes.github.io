title: Found inconsistent `return` statement

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Enforce consistent `return` statements.

Rules are:

1.  if any `return` has a value, all `return` nodes should have a value
2.  do not place `return` without a value at the end of a function

This rule respects `mypy` style of placing `return` statements. There
should be no conflict with these two checks.

Reasoning: This is done for pure consistency and readability of your
code. Eventually, this rule may also find some bugs in your code.

Solution: Add or remove values from the `return` statements to make them
consistent. Remove `return` statement from the function end.

Example::

    # Correct:
    def function():
        if some:
            return 2
        return 1
    
    # Wrong:
    def function():
        if some:
            return
        return 1
