Forbid multiple equality comparisons with the same variable.

  - Reasoning:  
    Using double+ equality compare with `or` or double+ non-equality
    compare with `and` indicates that you have implicit `in` or `not in`
    condition. It is just hidden from you.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor compares to use `in` or `not in` clauses.

Example:

    # Correct:
    print(some in {'first', 'second'})
    print(some not in {'first', 'second'})
    
    # Wrong:
    print(some == 'first' or some == 'second')
    print(some != 'first' and some != 'second')
