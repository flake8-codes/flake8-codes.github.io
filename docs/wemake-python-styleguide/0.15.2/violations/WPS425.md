Forbid booleans as non-keyword parameters.

  - Reasoning:  
    Passing booleans as regular positional parameters is very
    non-descriptive. It is almost impossible to tell what this parameter
    means and you almost always have to look up the implementation to
    tell what is going on. The only exception from this rule is passing
    a boolean as a non-keyword argument when it is the only passed
    argument.

  - Solution:  
    Pass booleans as keywords only. This will help you to save extra
    context on what's going on.

Example:

    # Correct:
    UserRepository.update(True)
    UsersRepository.add(user, cache=True)
    
    # Wrong:
    UsersRepository.add(user, True)
