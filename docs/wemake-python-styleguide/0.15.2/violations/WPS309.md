Forbid comparisons where the argument doesn't come first.

Reasoning: It is hard to read the code when you have to shuffle the
ordering of the arguments all the time. Bring consistency to the

Solution: Refactor your comparison expression, place the argument first.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if some_x > 3:
    if 3 < some_x < 10:
    
    # Wrong:
    if 3 < some_x:
