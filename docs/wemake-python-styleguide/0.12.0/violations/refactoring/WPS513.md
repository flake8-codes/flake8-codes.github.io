title: Found implicit elif condition
---

Forbids to have implicit `elif` conditions.

## Reasoning
Nested `if` in `else` cases are bad for readability because of the
nesting level.

## Solution
Use `elif` on the same level.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if some:
        ...
    elif other:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if some:
        ...
    else:
        if other:
            ...
