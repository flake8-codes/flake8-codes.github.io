Forbid comparing types with `type()` function.

  - Reasoning:  
    When you compare types with `type()` function call it means that you
    break polymorphism and disallow child classes of a node to work
    here. That's incorrect.

  - Solution:  
    Use `isinstance` to compare types.

Example:

    # Correct:
    print(something, type(something))
    
    # Wrong:
    if type(something) == int:
        ...
