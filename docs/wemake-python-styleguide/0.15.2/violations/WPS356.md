title: Found an unnecessary iterable unpacking
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid unnecessary iterable unpacking.

Reasoning: We do this for consistency.

Solution: Do not use iterable unpacking when it's not necessary.

Example::

    # Correct:
    [1, *numbers, 99]
    {*iterable, *other_iterable}
    list(iterable)
    first, *iterable = other_iterable
    
    # Wrong:
    [*iterable]
    *iterable, = other_iterable
