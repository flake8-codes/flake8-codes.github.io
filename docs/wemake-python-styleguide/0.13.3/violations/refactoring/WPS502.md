title: Found simplifiable if condition

Forbids to have simplifiable `if` conditions.

## Reasoning
This complex construction can cause frustration among other
developers. It is longer, more verbose, and more complex.

## Solution
Use `bool()` to convert test values to boolean values. Or just leave
it as it is in case when your test already returns a boolean value.
Use can also use `not` keyword to switch boolean values.

## Example

    # Correct:
    my_bool = bool(some_call())
    other_value = 8 if some_call() else None
    
    # Wrong:
    my_bool = True if some_call() else False

We only check `if` nodes where `True` and `False` values are used. We
check both `if` nodes and `if` expressions.
