title: Found incorrect base class

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid anything other than a class as a base class.

We only check base classes and not keywords. They can be anything you
need.

Reasoning: In Python you can specify anything in the base classes slot.
In runtime this expression will be evaluated and executed. We need to
prevent dirty hacks in this field.

Solution: Use only attributes, names, and types to be your base classes.
Use `annotation` future import in case you use strings in base classes.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Test(module.ObjectName, MixinName, keyword=True): ...
    class GenericClass(Generic[ValueType]): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test((lambda: object)()): ...
