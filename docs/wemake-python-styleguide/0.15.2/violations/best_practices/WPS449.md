title: Found float used as a key
---

Forbid `float` keys.

## Reasoning
`float` is a very ugly data type. It has a lot of "precision"
errors. When we use `float` as keys we can hit this wall. Moreover,
we cannot use `float` keys with lists, by design.

## Solution
Use other data types: integers, decimals, or use fuzzy logic.

## Example

    # Correct:
    some = {1: 'a'}
    some[1]
    
    # Wrong:
    some = {1.0: 'a'}
    some[1.0]
