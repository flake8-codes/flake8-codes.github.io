Forbids to use imports like `import os.path`.

## Reasoning
There too many different ways to import something. We should pick
one style and stick to it. We have decided to use the readable one.

## Solution
Refactor your import statement.

## Example

    # Correct:
    from os import path
    
    # Wrong:
    import os.path

<div class="versionadded">

0.1.0

</div>

  - Note:  
    Returns Z301 as error code
