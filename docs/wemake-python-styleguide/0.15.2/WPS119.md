Forbid unicode names.

Reasoning:
    This should be forbidden for sanity, readability, and writability.

Solution:
    Rename your entities so that they contain only ASCII symbols.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes,
functions, methods, and classes.

Example::

    # Correct:
    some_variable = 'Text with russian: русский язык'

    # Wrong:
    переменная = 42
    some_變量 = ''
