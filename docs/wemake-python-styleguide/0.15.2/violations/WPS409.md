{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid heterogeneous operators in one comparison.

Note, that we do allow mixing `>` with `>=` and `<` with `<=` operators.

Reasoning: This is hard to read and understand.

Solution: Refactor the expression to have separate parts joined with
`and` boolean operator.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if x == y == z:
        ...
    
    if x > y >= z:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if x > y == 5:
        ...
    
    if x == y != z:
        ...
