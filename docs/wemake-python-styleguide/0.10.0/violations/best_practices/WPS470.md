title: Found incorrect not with compare usage
---

Forbids to use `not` with compare expressions.

## Reasoning
This version of `not` operator is unreadable.

## Solution
Refactor the expression without `not` operator. Change the compare
signs.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if x <= 5:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if not x > 5:
        ...
