title: 'Found a condition with too much logic: _'
---

Forbid conditions with too many logical operators.

We use `MAX_CONDITIONS` as a default
value.

## Reasoning
When reading through the complex conditions you will fail to
understand all the possible branches. And you will end up putting
debug breakpoint on this line just to figure out how it works.

## Solution
We can reduce the complexity of a single `if` by doing two things:
creating new variables or creating nested `if` statements. Both of
these actions will trigger other complexity checks.

We count `and` and `or` keywords as conditions.
