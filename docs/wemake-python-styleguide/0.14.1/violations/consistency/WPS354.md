title: Found consecutive yield expressions
---

Forbids to have consecutive `yield` expressions.

We raise this violation when we find at least two consecutive `yield`
expressions.

## Reasoning
One can write multiple `yield` nodes in a row. That's incosistent.
Because we have `yield from` form.

## Solution
It can be easily changed to `yield from (...)` format.
