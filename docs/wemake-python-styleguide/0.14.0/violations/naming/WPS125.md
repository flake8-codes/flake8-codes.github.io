title: 'Found builtin shadowing: _'

Forbids to have variable or module names which shadows builtin names.

## Reasoning
Your code simply breaks Python. After you create `list = 1`, you
cannot not call `builtin` function `list` and what can be worth than
that?

## Solution
Rename your entity not to shadow Python builtins.

## Example

    # Correct:
    my_list = list(some_other)
    
    # Wrong:
    str = ''
    list = [1, 2, 3]
