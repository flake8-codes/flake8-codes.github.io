title: Found nested try block
---

Forbid nested `try` blocks.

Notice, we check all possible slots for `try` block: 1. the `try` block
itself 2. all `except` cases 3. `else` case 4. and `finally` case

## Reasoning
Nesting `try` blocks indicates that something really bad happens to
your logic. Why does it require two separate exception handlers? It
is a perfect case to refactor your code.

## Solution
Collapse two exception handlers together. Or create a separate
function that will handle this second nested case.

Example:

    # Wrong:
    try:
        try:
            ...
        except SomeException:
            ...
    except SomeOtherException:
        ...
    
    try:
        ...
    except SomeOtherException:
        try:
            ...
        except SomeException:
            ...
