Forbid `NotImplemented` exception.

Reasoning: `NotImplemented` and `NotImplementedError` look similar but
they have different use cases. Use cases of `NotImplemented` are too
limited to be generally available.

Solution: Use `NotImplementedError`.

Example::

    # Correct:
    raise NotImplementedError('To be done')
    
    # Wrong:
    raise NotImplemented
