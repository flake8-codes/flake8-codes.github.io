title: Found statement that has no effect
---

Forbids to have statements that do nothing.

## Reasoning
Statements that just access the value or expressions used as
statements indicate that your code contains deadlines. They just
pollute your codebase and do nothing.

## Solution
Refactor your code in case it was a typo or error. Or just delete
this code.

## Example

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        price = 8 + 2
        return price
    
    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        8 + 2
        print
