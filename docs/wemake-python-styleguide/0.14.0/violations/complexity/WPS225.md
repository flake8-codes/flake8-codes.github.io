title: 'Found too many except cases: _'
---

Forbids to have too many `except` cases in a single `try` clause.

We use {{ wps.constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAX_EXCEPT_CASES') }} as a
default value.

## Reasoning
Handling too many exceptions in a single place is a good indicator
of a bad design. Since this way, one controlling structure will
become too complex. And you will need to test a lot of paths your
application might go.

## Solution
We can reduce the complexity of this case by splitting it into
multiple `try` cases, functions or using a decorator to handle
different exceptions.
