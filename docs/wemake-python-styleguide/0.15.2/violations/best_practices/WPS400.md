internalName: WrongMagicCommentViolation
title: 'Found wrong magic comment: _'
---

Restrict various control (such as magic) comments.

We do not allow:

1.  `# noqa` comment without specified violations
2.  `# type: some_type` comments to specify a type for `typed_ast`

This violation is reported at the top of the module, so it cannot be
locally ignored.

## Reasoning
We cover several use-cases in a single rule. `# noqa` comment is
restricted because it can hide other violations. `# type: some_type`
comment is restricted because we can use type annotations instead.

## Solution
Use `# noqa` comments with specified error types. Use type
annotations to specify types.

We still allow using `# type: ignore` comment, since sometimes it is
required.

## Example

    # Correct:
    type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa: WPS125
    coordinate: int = 10
    some.int_field = 'text'  # type: ignore
    
    number: int
    for number in some_untyped_iterable():
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa
    coordinate = 10  # type: int
