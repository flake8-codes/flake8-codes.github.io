title: Found comparison with float or complex number
---

Forbids comparisons with `float` and `complex`.

  - Reasoning:  
    This is a best practice rule, as `float` and `complex` suffer from
    representation error, leading to possibly incorrect results during
    comparison.

  - Solution:  
    Use fuzzy operators. 1. `abs(f1 - f2) <= allowed_error` 2.
    `math.isclose(f1, f2)` (for `float`) 3. `cmath.isclose(c1, c2)` (for
    `complex`) 4. Custom logic, not using operators

Example:

    # Correct:
    math.isclose(3.0, 0.3 / 0.1)
    cmath.isclose(3 + 4j, (0.3 + 0.4j) / 0.1)
    
    # Wrong:
    3.0 == 0.3 / 0.1
    3 + 4j == (0.3 + 0.4j) / 0.1
