title: Found extra `object` in parent classes list
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid extra `object` in parent classes list.

  - Reasoning:  
    We should allow object only when we explicitly use it as a single
    parent class. When there is another class or there are multiple
    parents - we should not allow it for the consistency reasons.

  - Solution:  
    Remove extra `object` parent class from the list.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class SomeClassName(object): ...
    class SomeClassName(FirstParentClass, SecondParentClass): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class SomeClassName(FirstParentClass, SecondParentClass, object): ...
