Forbid comparing values with constants using `is` or `is not`.

However, we allow to compare with `None` and booleans.

## Reasoning
`is` compares might not do what you want them to do. Firstly, they
check for the same object, not equality. Secondly, they behave
unexpectedly even with the simple values like `257`.

## Solution
Use `==` to compare with constants.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if my_check == [1, 2, 3]:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if my_check is [1, 2, 3]:
        ...
