title: Found incorrectly nested ternary
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid nesting ternary expressions in certain places.

Note, that we restrict to nest ternary expressions inside:

  - `if` conditions
  - boolean and binary operations like `and` or `+`
  - unary operators

<!-- end list -->

  - Reasoning:  
    Nesting ternary in random places can lead to very hard debug and
    testing problems.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor the ternary expression to be either a new variable, or
    nested `if` statement, or a new function.

Example:

    # Correct:
    some = x if cond() else y
    
    # Wrong:
    if x if cond() else y:
        ...
