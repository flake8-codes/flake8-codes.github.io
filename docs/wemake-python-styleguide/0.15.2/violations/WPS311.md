title: Found multiple `in` compares
---

Forbid comparisons with multiple `in` checks.

  - Reasoning:  
    Using multiple `in` checks is unreadable.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your comparison expression to use several `and` conditions
    or separate `if` statements in cases where it is appropriate.

Example:

    # Correct:
    if item in bucket and bucket in master_list_of_buckets:
    if x_coord not in line and line not in square:
    
    # Wrong:
    if item in bucket in master_list_of_buckets:
    if x_cord not in line not in square:
