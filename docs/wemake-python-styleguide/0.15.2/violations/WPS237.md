title: Found a too complex `f` string

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids `f` strings that are too complex.

A complex format string is defined as use of any formatted value that is
not:

  - the value of a variable
  - the value of a collection through lookup with a variable, number, or
    string as the key
  - the return value of a procedure call without arguments

Related to `~FormattedStringViolation`.

  - Reasoning:  
    Complex `f` strings are often difficult to understand, making the
    code less readable. Generally we don't allow `f` strings but this
    violation exists in case the user decides to ignore the general
    violation.

  - Solution:  
    Use `.format()` or assign complex expressions to variables before
    formatting.

Example:

    # Correct:
    f'smth {user.get_full_name()}'
    
    # Wrong:
    f'{reverse("url-name")}?{"&".join("user="+uid for uid in user_ids)}'
