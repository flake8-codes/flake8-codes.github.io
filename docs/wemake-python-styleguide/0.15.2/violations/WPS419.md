title: Found `try`/`else`/`finally` with multiple return paths

Forbid multiple returning paths with `try` / `except` case.

Note, that we check for any `return`, `break`, or `raise` nodes.

  - Reasoning:  
    The problem with `return` in `else` and `finally` is that it is
    impossible to say what value is going to be returned without looking
    up the implementation details. Why? Because `return` does not expect
    that some other code will be executed after it. But, `finally` is
    always executed, even after `return`. And `else` will not be
    executed when there are no exceptions in `try` case and a `return`
    statement.

  - Solution:  
    Remove `return` from one of the cases.

Example:

    # Correct:
    try:
        return 1
    except YourException:
        ...
    finally:
        clear_things_up()
    
    # Wrong:
    try:
        return 1  # this line will never return
    except Exception:
        ...
    finally:
        return 2  # this line will actually return
    
    try:
        return 1  # this line will actually return
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        ...
    else:
        return 0  # this line will never return
