Forbid functions with too much cognitive complexity.

  - Reasoning:  
    People are not great at reading and interpreting code in their
    heads. That's why code with a lot of nested loops, conditions,
    exceptions handlers, and context managers is hard to read and
    understand.

  - Solution:  
    Rewrite your code to be simpler. Use flat structures and conditions,
    remove nested loops.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `` `--max-cognitive-score ``.
    Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_COGNITIVE_SCORE') }}
