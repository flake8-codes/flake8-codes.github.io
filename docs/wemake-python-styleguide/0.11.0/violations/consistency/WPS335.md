title: Found incorrect for loop iter type
---

Forbids to use lists and dicts as `for` loop iter targets.

## Reasoning
Compares where comparators start from the lowest element are easier
to read than one that start from the biggest one. It is also
possible to write the same expression in two separate way, which is
incosistent.

## Solution
Use tuples to create explicit iterables for `for` loops.

## Example

    # Correct:
    for person in ('Kim', 'Nick'):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for person in ['Kim', 'Nick']:
        ...
