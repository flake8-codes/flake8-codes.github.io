{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid too many `` `except `` cases in a single `` `try `` clause.

We use {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAX_EXCEPT_CASES') }} as
a default value.

  - Reasoning:  
    Handling too many exceptions in a single place is a good indicator
    of a bad design since one controlling structure will become too
    complex. Also, you will need to test a lot of logic paths in your
    application.

  - Solution:  
    We can reduce the complexity of this case by splitting it into
    multiple `` `try `` cases, functions or using a decorator to handle
    different exceptions.
