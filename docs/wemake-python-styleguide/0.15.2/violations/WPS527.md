Require tuples as arguments for certain functions.

Reasoning: For some functions, it is better to use tuples instead of
another iterable types (list, sets,...) as arguments.

Solution: Use tuples as arguments.

Example::

    # Correct:
    a = frozenset((2,))
    
    # Wrong:
    a = frozenset([2])
