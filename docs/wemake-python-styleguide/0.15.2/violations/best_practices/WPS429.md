title: Found multiple assign targets
---

Forbid multiple assignments on the same line.

## Reasoning
Multiple assignments on the same line might not do what you think
they do. They can also grow pretty long and you might not notice the
rising complexity of your code.

## Solution
Use separate lines for each assignment.

Example:

    # Correct:
    a = 1
    b = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    a = b = 1
