title: Found reversed complex compare
---

Forbids to have reversed order complex compare expressions.

## Reasoning
Compares where comparators start from the lowest element are easier
to read than one that start from the biggest one. It is also
possible to write the same expression in two separate way, which is
incosistent.

## Solution
Reverse the order, so the smallest element comes the first and the
biggest one comes the last.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if three < two < one:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if one > two > three:
        ...
