title: Found implicit complex compare
---

Forbids to have implicit complex compare expressions.

## Reasoning
Two compares in python that are joined with `and` operator mean that
you indeed have a complex compare with tree operators.

## Solution
Refactor your compare without `and` but with the third operator.
Notice, that you might have to change the ordering.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if three < two < one:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if one > two and two > three:
        ...
