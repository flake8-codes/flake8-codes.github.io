title: Found incorrect `__slots__` syntax
---


Forbid incorrect ``__slots__`` definition.

Things that this rule checks:

- That ``__slots__`` is a tuple, name, attribute, star, or call
- That ``__slots__`` do not have duplicates
- That ``__slots__`` do not have empty strings or invalid python names

Reasoning:
    ``__slots__`` is a very special attribute.
    It completely changes your class. So, we need to be careful with it.
    We should not allow anything rather than tuples to define slots,
    we also need to check that fields defined in ``__slots__`` are unique.

Solution:
    Use tuples with unique elements to define ``__slots__`` attribute.
    Use ``snake_case`` to define attributes in ``__slots__``.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Test(object):
        __slots__ = ('field1', 'field2')

    class Other(Test):
        __slots__ = (*Test.__slots__, 'child')

    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        __slots__ = ['field1', 'field2', 'field2']

Note, that we do ignore all complex expressions for this field.
So, we only check raw literals.
