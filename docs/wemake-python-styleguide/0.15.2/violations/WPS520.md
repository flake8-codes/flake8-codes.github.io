Forbid comparing with explicit falsy constants.

We allow to compare with falsy numbers, strings, booleans, ``None``.
We disallow complex constants like tuple, dicts, and lists.

Reasoning:
    When comparing ``something`` with explicit falsy constants
    what we really mean is ``not something``.

Solution:
    Use ``not`` with your variable.
    Fix your data types.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if not my_check:
        ...

    if some_other is None:
        ...

    if some_num == 0:
        ...

    # Wrong:
    if my_check == []:
        ...
