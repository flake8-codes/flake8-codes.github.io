Forbid importing protected objects from modules.

Related to `~ProtectedModuleViolation`.

  - Reasoning:  
    When importing a protected modules' members, we break the contract
    which the authors of this module enforce. By disrespecting
    encapsulation, we may break the code at any moment.

  - Solution:  
    Do not import protected objects from modules. Respect the
    encapsulation.

Example:

    # Correct:
    from some.public.module import FooClass
    
    # Wrong:
    from some.module import _protected
    from some.module import _protected as not_protected
