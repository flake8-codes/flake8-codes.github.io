title: Found `StopIteration` raising inside generator
---


Forbid raising ``StopIteration`` inside generators.

Reasoning:
    ``StopIteration`` should not be raised explicitly in generators.

Solution:
    Use a return statement to get out of a generator.

Example::

    # Correct:
    def some_generator():
        if some_value:
            return
        yield 1

    # Wrong:
    def some_generator():
        if some_value:
            raise StopIteration
        yield 1
