title: Found incorrect multi-line string
---

Forbid triple quotes for singleline strings.

## Reasoning
String quotes should be consistent.

## Solution
Use single quotes for single-line strings. Triple quotes are only
allowed for real multiline strings.

Example:

    # Correct:
    single_line = 'abc'
    multiline = """
        one
        two
    """
    
    # Wrong:
    some_string = """abc"""
    some_bytes = b"""123"""

Docstrings are ignored from this rule. You must use triple quotes
strings for docstrings.
