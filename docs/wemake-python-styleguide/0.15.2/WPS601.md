title: 'Found shadowed class attribute: {0}'

Forbid shadowing class level attributes with instance level attributes.

  - Reasoning:  
    This way you will have two attributes inside your `__mro__` chain:
    one from instance and one from class. It might cause errors.
    Needless to say, that this is just pointless to do so.
    
    Also, if you ever want to optimise your code with a tool like
    [mypyc](https://github.com/python/mypy/tree/master/mypyc), this rule
    is a requirement.

  - Solution:  
    Use either class attributes or instance attributes. Use `ClassVar`
    type on fields that are declared as class attributes.

Note, that we cannot find shadowed attributes that are defined in parent
classes. That's where `ClassVar` is required for `mypy` to check it for
you.

Example:

    # Correct:
    from typing import ClassVar
    
    class First(object):
        field: ClassVar[int] = 1
    
    class Second(object):
        field: int
    
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            self.field = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    class Some(object):
        field = 1
    
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            self.field = 1
