Forbid uppercase `X`, `O`, `B`, and `E` in numbers.

  - Reasoning:  
    Octal, hex, binary and scientific notation suffixes could be written
    in two possible notations: lowercase and uppercase which brings
    confusion and decreases code consistency and readability. We enforce
    a single way to write numbers with suffixes: suffix with lowercase
    chars.

  - Solution:  
    Octal, hex, binary and scientific notation suffixes in numbers
    should be written in lowercase.

Example:

    # Correct:
    hex_number = 0xFF
    octal_number = 0o11
    binary_number = 0b1001
    number_with_scientific_notation = 1.5e+10
    
    # Wrong:
    hex_number = 0XFF
    octal_number = 0O11
    binary_number = 0B1001
    number_with_scientific_notation = 1.5E+10
