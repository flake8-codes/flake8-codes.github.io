title: Found reassigning variable to itself
---

Forbids to assign variable to itself.

## Reasoning
There is no need to do that. Generally it is an indication of some
error or just dead code.

## Example

    # Correct:
    some = some + 1
    x_coord, y_coord = y_coord, x_coord
    
    # Wrong:
    some = some
    x_coord, y_coord = x_coord, y_coord
