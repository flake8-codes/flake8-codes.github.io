title: 'Found exponent number with positive exponent: _'

Forbid extra `+` signs in the exponent.

## Reasoning
Positive exponent is positive by default, there's no need to write
an extra `+` sign. We enforce consistency with this rule.

## Solution
Remove meaningless `+` sign from the exponent.

Example:

    # Correct:
    number = 1e1 + 1e-1
    
    # Wrong:
    number = 1e+1
