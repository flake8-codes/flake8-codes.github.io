{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid incorrectly named keywords in starred dicts.

Reasoning: Using the incorrect keywords in a starred dict. Eg.:
`print(**{'@': 1})`.

Solution: Don't use incorrect identifiers as keywords.

Example::

    # Correct:
    print(**{'end': '|'})
    
    # Wrong:
    print(**{'3end': '|'})
