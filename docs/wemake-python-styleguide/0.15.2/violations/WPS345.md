Forbid meaningless math operations with `0` and `1`.

  - Reasoning:  
    Adding and subtracting zero does not change the value. There's no
    need to do that. Multiplying by zero is also redundant: it can be
    replaced with explicit `0` assign. Multiplying and dividing by `1`
    is also meaningless. Likewise, using `|` or `^` with `0`, and using
    the `%` operator with `1` are unnecessary.

  - Solution:  
    Remove useless operations.

Example:

    # Correct:
    number = 1
    zero = 0
    one = 1
    three = 3
    
    # Wrong:
    number = 1 + 0 * 1
    zero = some * 0 / 1
    one = some ** 0 ** 1
    three = 3 ^ 0
    three = 3 | 0
    three = 3 % 1
