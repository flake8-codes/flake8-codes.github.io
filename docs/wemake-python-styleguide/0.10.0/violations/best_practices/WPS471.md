title: Found heterogenous compare
---

Forbids to heterogenous operators in one compare.

Note, that we allow to mix `>` with `>=` and `<` with `<=` operators.

## Reasoning
This is hard to read and understand.

## Solution
Refactor the expression to have separate parts joined with `and`
boolean operator.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if x == y == z:
        ...
    
    if x > y >= z:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if x > y == 5:
        ...
    
    if x == y != z:
        ...
