{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid meaningless math operations with `0` and `1`.

Reasoning: Adding and subtracting zero does not change the value.
There's no need to do that. Multiplying by zero is also redundant: it
can be replaced with explicit `0` assign. Multiplying and dividing by
`1` is also meaningless. Likewise, using `|` or `^` with `0`, and using
the `%` operator with `1` are unnecessary.

Solution: Remove useless operations.

Example::

    # Correct:
    number = 1
    zero = 0
    one = 1
    three = 3
    
    # Wrong:
    number = 1 + 0 * 1
    zero = some * 0 / 1
    one = some ** 0 ** 1
    three = 3 ^ 0
    three = 3 | 0
    three = 3 % 1
