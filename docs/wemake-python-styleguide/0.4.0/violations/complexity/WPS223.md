title: 'Found too many elif branches: _'
---

Forbids to use many `elif` branches.

## Reasoning
This rule is specifically important, because many `elif` branches
indicate a complex flow in your design: you are reimplementing
`switch` in python.

## Solution
There are different design patters to use instead. For example, you
can use some interface that just call a specific method without
`if`.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-elifs`. Default:
`MAX_ELIFS`
