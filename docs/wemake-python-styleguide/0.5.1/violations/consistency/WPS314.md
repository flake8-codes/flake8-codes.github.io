internalName: WrongConditionalViolation
title: Conditional always evaluates to same result
---

Forbids using `if` statements that use invalid conditionals.

## Reasoning
When invalid conditional arguments are used it is typically an
indication of a mistake, since the value of the conditional result
will always be the same.

## Solution
Remove the conditional and any associated dead code.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if value is True: ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if True: ...
