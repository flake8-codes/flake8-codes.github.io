title: Found an iterable unpacking to list

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}


Forbids to unpack iterable objects to lists.

Reasoning:
    We do this for consistency.

Solution:
    Do not unpack iterables to lists, use tuples for that.

Example::

    # Correct:
    first, second = (7, 4)
    first, *iterable = other_iterable

    # Wrong:
    [first, second] = (7, 4)
    [first, *iterable] = other_iterable
