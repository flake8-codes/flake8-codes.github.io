title: Found too long compare
---

Forbid compare expressions that are too long.

  - Reasoning:  
    Compare expressions that are too long indicate that there's
    something wrong going on in the code. Compares should not be longer
    than 3 or 4 items.

  - Solution:  
    Use several conditions, separate variables, or functions.
