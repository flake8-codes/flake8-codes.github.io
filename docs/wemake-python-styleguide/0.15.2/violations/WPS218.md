Forbid placing too many ``assert`` statements into a function.

Reasoning:
    When there are too many ``assert`` keywords,
    functions are starting to get really complex.
    It might indicate that your tests or contracts are too big.

Solution:
    Create rich ``assert`` statements, use higher-level contracts,
    or create special guard functions.

Configuration:
    This rule is configurable with ``--max-asserts``.
