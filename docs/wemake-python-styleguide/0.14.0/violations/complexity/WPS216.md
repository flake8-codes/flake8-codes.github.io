title: 'Too many decorators: _'
---

Restrict the maximum number of decorators.

## Reasoning
When you are using too many decorators it means that you try to
overuse the magic. You have to ask yourself: do I really know what
happens inside this decorator tree? Typically, the answer will be
"no".

## Solution
Using too many decorators typically means that you try to configure
the behavior from outside of the class. Do not do that too much.
Split functions or classes into multiple ones. Use higher order
decorators.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-decorators`. Default:
`MAX_DECORATORS`

This rule checks: functions, methods, and classes.
