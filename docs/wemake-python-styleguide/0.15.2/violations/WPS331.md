{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid local variables that are only used in `return` statements.

We also allow cases when a variable is assigned, then there are some
other statements without direct variable access and the variable is
returned. We reserve this use-case to be able to do some extra work
before the function returns.

We also allow the return of partial, sorted, or modified tuple items
that are defined just above.

  - Reasoning:  
    This is done for consistency and more readable source code.

  - Solution:  
    Return the expression itself, instead of creating a temporary
    variable.

Example:

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        return 1
    
    def other_function():
        some_value = 1
        do_something(some_value)
        return some_value
    
    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        some_value = 1
        return some_value
