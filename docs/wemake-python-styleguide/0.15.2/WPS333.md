title: Found implicit complex compare
---


Forbid implicit complex comparison expressions.

Reasoning:
    Two comparisons in python that are joined with ``and`` operator
    mean that you have a complex comparison with tree operators.

Solution:
    Refactor your comparison without ``and`` but with the third operator.
    Notice that you might have to change the ordering.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if three < two < one:
        ...

    # Wrong:
    if one > two and two > three:
        ...
