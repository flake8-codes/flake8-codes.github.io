Forbids to use more than one consecutive underscore in variable names.

## Reasoning
This is done to gain extra readability. This naming rule already
exists for module names.

## Example

    # Correct:
    some_value = 5
    __magic__ = 5
    
    # Wrong:
    some__value = 5

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, and
methods.
