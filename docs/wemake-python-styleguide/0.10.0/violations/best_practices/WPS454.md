title: Found incorrect base class
---

Forbids to have anything else than a class as a base class.

## Reasoning
In Python you can specify anything in the base classes slot. In
runtime this expression will be evaluated and executed. We need to
prevent dirty hacks in this field.

## Solution
Use only attributes, names, and types to be your base classes.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class Test(module.ObjectName, MixinName, keyword=True): ...
    class GenericClass(Generic[ValueType]): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test((lambda: object)()): ...
