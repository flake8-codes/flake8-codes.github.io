title: 'Found same alias import: {0}'
---

Forbid using the same alias as the original name in imports.

  - Reasoning:  
    Why would you even do this in the first place?

Example:

    # Correct:
    from os import path
    
    # Wrong:
    from os import path as path

When <span class="title-ref">--i-control-code</span> is set to `False`
you can reexport things with `as`, because `mypy` might require it with
`implicit_reexport = False` setting turned on.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--i-control-code` and
    `--i-dont-control-code`. Default:
    `wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.I_CONTROL_CODE`
