Forbids to have blacklisted variable names.

## Reasoning
We have found some names that are not expressive enough. However,
they appear in the code more than often. All names that we forbid to
use could be improved.

## Solution
Try to use more specific name instead. If you really want to use any
of the names from the list, add a prefix or suffix to it. It will
serve you well.

See `VARIABLE_NAMES_BLACKLIST`
for the full list of blacklisted variable names.

## Example

    # Correct:
    html_node_item = None
    
    # Wrong:
    item = None

<div class="versionadded">

0.1.0

</div>
