{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid variable or module names which could be difficult to read.

  - Reasoning:  
    Currently one can name your classes like so: `ZerO0` Inside it is
    just `O` and `0`, but we cannot tell it from the word. There are a
    lot other combinations which are unreadable.

  - Solution:  
    Rename your entity not to contain unreadable sequences.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, methods,
and classes.

See
{{ wps.constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.UNREADABLE_CHARACTER_COMBINATIONS') }}
for full list of unreadable combinations.

Example:

    # Correct:
    ControlStatement
    AveragePrice
    
    # Wrong:
    Memo0Output
