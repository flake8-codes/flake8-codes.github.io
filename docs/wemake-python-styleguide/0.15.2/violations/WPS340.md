Forbid extra `+` signs in the exponent.

Reasoning: Positive exponent is positive by default, there's no need to
write an extra `+` sign. We enforce consistency with this rule.

Solution: Remove meaningless `+` sign from the exponent.

Example::

    # Correct:
    number = 1e1 + 1e-1
    
    # Wrong:
    number = 1e+1
