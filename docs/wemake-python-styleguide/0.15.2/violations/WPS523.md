title: Found incorrectly swapped variables

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid unpythonic variable swaps.

We check for `a = b; b = a` sequences.

  - Reasoning:  
    This looks like a failed attempt to swap.

  - Solution:  
    Use standard way to swap two variables.

Example:

    # Correct:
    a, b = b, a
    
    # Wrong:
    a = b
    b = a
    
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
