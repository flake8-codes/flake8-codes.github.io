{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid unused variables with multiple underscores.

  - Reasoning:  
    We only use `_` as a special definition for an unused variable.
    Other variables are hard to read. It is unclear why would one use
    it.

  - Solution:  
    Rename unused variables to `_` or give it some more context with an
    explicit name: `_context`.

Example:

    # Correct:
    some_element, _next_element, _ = some_tuple()
    some_element, _, _ = some_tuple()
    some_element, _ = some_tuple()
    
    # Wrong:
    some_element, _, __  = some_tuple()
