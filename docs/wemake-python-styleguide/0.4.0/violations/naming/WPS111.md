title: 'Found too short name: _'
---

Forbids to have too short variable or module names.

## Reasoning
It is hard to understand what the variable means and why it is used,
if it's name is too short.

## Solution
Think of another name. Give more context to it.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, methods,
and classes.

## Example

    # Correct:
    x_coordinate = 1
    abscissa = 2
    
    # Wrong:
    x = 1
    y = 2

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--min-name-length`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_NAME_LENGTH') }}
