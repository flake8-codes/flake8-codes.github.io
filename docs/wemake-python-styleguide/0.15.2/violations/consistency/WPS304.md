Forbid partial floats like `.05` or `23.`.

  - Reasoning:  
    Partial numbers are hard to read and they can be confused with other
    numbers. For example, it is really easy to confuse `0.5` and `.05`
    when reading through the source code.

  - Solution:  
    Use full versions with leading and trailing zeros.

Example:

    # Correct:
    half = 0.5
    ten_float = 10.0
    
    # Wrong:
    half = .5
    ten_float = 10.
