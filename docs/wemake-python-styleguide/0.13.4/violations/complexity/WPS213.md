title: 'Found too many expressions: _'
---

Forbids putting too many expressions in a single function.

This rule is quite similar to "max lines" in a function, but is much
nicer. Because we don't count lines, we count real code entities. This
way adding just several extra empty lines for readability will never
trigger this violation.

Related to {{ wps.violation('OverusedExpressionViolation') }}.

## Reasoning
When there are too many expressions it means that this specific
function does too many things at once. It has too much logic.

## Solution
Split function into several functions, refactor your API.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-expressions`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_EXPRESSIONS') }}
