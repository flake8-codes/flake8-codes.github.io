internalName: NegatedConditionsViolation
title: Found negated condition
---

Forbids to use negated conditions together with `else` clause.

## Reasoning
It easier to read and name regular conditions. Not negated ones.

## Solution
Move actions from the negated `if` condition to the `else`
condition.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if some == 1:
         ...
    else:
         ...
    
    if not some:
         ...
    
    if not some:
        ...
    elif other:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if not some:
         ...
    else:
         ...
