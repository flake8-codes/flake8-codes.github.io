Forbid subclassing lowercase builtins.

We forbid to subclass builtins like ``int``, ``str``, ``bool``, etc.
We allow to subclass ``object`` and ``type``, warnings, and exceptions.

See
:py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.ALLOWED_BUILTIN_CLASSES`
for the whole list of whitelisted names.

Reasoning:
    It is almost never a good idea (unless you do something sneaky)
    to subclass primitive builtins.

Solution:
    Use custom objects around some wrapper.
    Use magic methods to emulate the desired behaviour.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Some(object): ...
    class MyValueException(ValueError): ...

    # Wrong:
    class MyInt(int): ...
