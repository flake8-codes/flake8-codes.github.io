{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `BaseException` exception.

Reasoning: We can silence system exit and keyboard interrupt with this
exception handler. It is almost the same as raw `except:` block.

Solution: Handle `Exception`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, `GeneratorExit`, and
`SystemExit` separately. Do not use the plain `except:` keyword.

Example::

    # Correct:
    except Exception as ex: ...
    
    # Wrong:
    except BaseException as ex: ...

.. versionadded:: 0.3.0
