title: Found extra `object` in parent classes list
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid extra `object` in parent classes list.

Reasoning: We should allow object only when we explicitly use it as a
single parent class. When there is another class or there are multiple
parents - we should not allow it for the consistency reasons.

Solution: Remove extra `object` parent class from the list.

Example::

# Correct:

class SomeClassName(object): ... class SomeClassName(FirstParentClass,
SecondParentClass): ...

# Wrong:

class SomeClassName(FirstParentClass, SecondParentClass, object): ...
