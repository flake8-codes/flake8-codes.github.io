title: Found local variable that are only used in return statements
---

Forbid local variable that are only used in `return` statements.

This is done for consistency and more readable source code.

## Solution

<span class="title-ref">\`return</span> statements

## Example

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        return 1
    
    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        some_value = 1
        return some_value
