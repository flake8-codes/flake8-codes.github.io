Forbid names with underscored numbers pattern.

## Reasoning
This is done for consistency in naming.

## Solution
Do not put an underscore between text and numbers, that is
confusing. Rename your variable or modules do not include
underscored numbers.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, method, and
classes. Please, note that putting an underscore that replaces `-` in
some names between numbers are fine, example: `ISO-123-456` would become
`iso123_456`.

## Example

    # Correct:
    star_wars_episode2 = 'awesome!'
    iso123_456 = 'some data'
    
    # Wrong:
    star_wars_episode_2 = 'not so awesome'
    iso_123_456 = 'some data'
