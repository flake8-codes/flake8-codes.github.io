Forbid short variable or module names.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is hard to understand what the variable means and why it is used,
    if its name is too short.

  - Solution:  
    Think of another name. Give more context to it.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, methods,
and classes.

We do not count trailing and leading underscores when calculating
length.

Example:

    # Correct:
    x_coordinate = 1
    abscissa = 2
    
    # Wrong:
    x = 1
    y = 2

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--min-name-length`. Default:
    `wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MIN_NAME_LENGTH`
