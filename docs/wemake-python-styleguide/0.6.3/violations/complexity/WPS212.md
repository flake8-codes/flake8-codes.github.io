title: 'Found too many return statements: _'
---

Forbids placing too many `return` statements into the function.

## Reasoning
When there are too many `return` keywords, functions are hard to
test. They are also hard to read and hard to change and keep
everything inside your head at once.

## Solution
Change your design.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-returns`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_RETURNS') }}
