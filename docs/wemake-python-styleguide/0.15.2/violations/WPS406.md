title: Found wrong context manager variable definition
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid anything other than `` `ast.Name `` to define contexts.

  - Reasoning:  
    When defining a `` `with `` context managers with attributes,
    indexes, calls, or any other nodes it does dirty things inside.

  - Solution:  
    Use regular `` `ast.Name `` variables. Or tuple of `` `ast.Name ``
    variables. Star names are also fine.

Example:

    # Correct:
    with open('README.md') as readme:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    with open('README.md') as files['readme']:
        ...
