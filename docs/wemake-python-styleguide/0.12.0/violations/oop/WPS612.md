title: 'Found useless overwritten method: _'

Forbids to have useless overwritten methods.

## Reasoning
Overwriting method without any changes does not have any positive
impact.

## Solution
Do not overwrite method in case you do not want to do any changes
inside it.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class Test(Base):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        def method(self, argument):
            return super().method(argument)
