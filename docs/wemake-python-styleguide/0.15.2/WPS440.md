Forbid overlapping local and block variables.

What we call local variables:

1. Assigns and annotations
2. Function arguments (they are local to the function body)

What we call block variables:

1. Imports
2. Functions and async functions definitions
3. Classes, methods, and async methods definitions
4. For and async for loops variables
5. Except for block exception aliases

We allow local variables to overlap themselves,
we forbid block variables to overlap themselves.

Example::

    # Correct:
    my_value = 1
    my_value = my_value + 1

    # Wrong:
    import my_value
    my_value = 1  # overlaps with import
