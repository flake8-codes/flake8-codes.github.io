title: Found wrong for loop variable definition
---

Forbids to use anything rather than `ast.Name` to define loop variables.

## Reasoning
When defining a `for` loop with attributes, indexes, calls, or any
other nodes it does dirty things inside.

## Solution
Use regular `ast.Name` variables. Or tuple of `ast.Name` variables.

## Example

    # Correct:
    for person in database.people():
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for context['pepson'] in database.people():
        ...
