Forbids to have duplicate items in `set` literals.

## Reasoning
When you explicitly put duplicate items in `set` literals it just
does not make any sense. Since `set` can not contain duplicate items
and they will be removed anyway.

## Solution
Remove the duplicate items.

## Example

    # Correct:
    some_set = {'a', variable1}
    some_set = {make_call(), make_call()}
    
    # Wrong:
    some_set = {'a', 'a', variable1, variable1}

Things that we consider duplicates: builtins and variables. These nodes
are not checked because they may return different results:

  - function and method calls
  - comprehensions
  - attributes
  - subscribe operations
  - containers: lists, dicts, tuples, sets
