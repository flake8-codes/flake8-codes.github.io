Forbid shadowing variables from outer scopes.

We check the function, method, and module scopes. While we do not check
the class scope. Because class level constants are not available via
regular name, and they are scope to `ClassName.var_name`.

  - Reasoning:  
    Shadowing can lead you to a big pile of storage and unexpected bugs.

  - Solution:  
    Use different names and do not allow scoping.

Example:

    # Correct:
    def test(): ...
    
    def other():
        test1 = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    def test(): ...
    
    def other():
        test = 1  # shadows `test()` function
