title: 'Found too many public instance attributes: _'
---

Forbid instances with too many public attributes.

We only check static definitions in a form of `self.public = ...`. We do
not count parent attributes. We do not count properties. We do not count
annotations. We do not count class attributes. We do not count
duplicates.

  - Reasoning:  
    Having too many public instance attributes means that your class is
    too complex in terms of coupling. Other classes and functions will
    rely on these concrete fields instead of better abstraction layers.

  - Solution:  
    Make some attributes protected. Split this class into several. If
    the class is a Data Transfer Object, then use `@dataclass`
    decorator.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-attributes`. Default:
    {{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_ATTRIBUTES') }}
