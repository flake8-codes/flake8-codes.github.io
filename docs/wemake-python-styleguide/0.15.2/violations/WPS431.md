Forbid nested classes.

Reasoning: Nested classes are really hard to manage. You cannot even
create an instance of this class in many cases. Testing them is also
really hard.

Solution: Just write flat classes, there's no need to nest them. If you
are nesting classes inside a function for parametrization, then you will
probably need to use a different design (or metaclasses).

Configuration: This rule is configurable with
`--nested-classes-whitelist`. Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.NESTED_CLASSES_WHITELIST') }}

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Some(object): ...
    class Other(object): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Some(object):
        class Inner(object):
            ...
