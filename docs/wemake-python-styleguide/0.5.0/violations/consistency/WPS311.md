internalName: MultipleInComparisonViolation
title: Found multiple in comparisons
---

Forbids comparision where multiple `in` checks.

## Reasoning
Using multiple `in` is unreadable.

## Solution
Refactor your comparison expression to use several `and` conditions
or separate `if` statements in case it is appropriate.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if item in bucket and bucket in master_list_of_buckets:
    if x_coord in line and line in square:
    
    # Wrong:
    if item in bucket in master_list_of_buckets:
    if x_cord in line in square:
