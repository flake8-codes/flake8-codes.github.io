title: Found multiple assign targets
---


Forbid multiple assignments on the same line.

Reasoning:
    Multiple assignments on the same line might not do what you think
    they do. They can also grow pretty long and you might not notice
    the rising complexity of your code.

Solution:
    Use separate lines for each assignment.

Example::

    # Correct:
    a = 1
    b = 1

    # Wrong:
    a = b = 1
