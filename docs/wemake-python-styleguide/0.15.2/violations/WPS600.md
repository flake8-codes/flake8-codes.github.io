Forbid subclassing lowercase builtins.

We forbid to subclass builtins like `int`, `str`, `bool`, etc. We allow
to subclass `object` and `type`, warnings, and exceptions.

See :py`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.ALLOWED_BUILTIN_CLASSES` for
the whole list of whitelisted names.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is almost never a good idea (unless you do something sneaky) to
    subclass primitive builtins.

  - Solution:  
    Use custom objects around some wrapper. Use magic methods to emulate
    the desired behaviour.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class Some(object): ...
    class MyValueException(ValueError): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class MyInt(int): ...
