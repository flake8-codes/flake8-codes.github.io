code: 603
title: 'Found using restricted magic method: {0}'
---


Forbid certain magic methods.

Reasoning:
    We forbid to use magic methods related to the forbidden language parts.
    Likewise, we forbid to use ``del`` keyword, so we forbid to use all
    magic methods related to it.

Solution:
    Refactor your code to use custom methods instead.
    It will give more context to your app.

See
:py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAGIC_METHODS_BLACKLIST`
for the full blacklist of the magic methods.
