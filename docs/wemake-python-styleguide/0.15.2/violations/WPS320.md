Forbid multi-line function type annotations.

Reasoning: Functions with multi-line type annotations are unreadable.

Solution: Use type annotations that fit into a single line to annotate
functions. If your annotation is too long, then use type aliases.

Example::

    # Correct:
    def create_list(length: int) -> List[int]:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    def create_list(length: int) -> List[
        int,
    ]:
        ...

This rule checks argument and return type annotations.
