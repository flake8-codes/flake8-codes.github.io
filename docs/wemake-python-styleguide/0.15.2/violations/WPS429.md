Forbid multiple assignments on the same line.

Reasoning: Multiple assignments on the same line might not do what you
think they do. They can also grow pretty long and you might not notice
the rising complexity of your code.

Solution: Use separate lines for each assignment.

Example::

    # Correct:
    a = 1
    b = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    a = b = 1
