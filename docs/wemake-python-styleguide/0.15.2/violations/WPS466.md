Forbid using complex grammar for using decorators.

This violation is only raised for `python3.9+`, earlier versions do not
have this concept.

  - Reasoning:  
    New grammar allows to use decorators in a more liberal way. It is
    probably not a good idea. Because decorators should be simple and
    easy to read.

  - Solution:  
    Use names, attributes, and calls as decorators only. You are free to
    pass any args to function calls, however.

Example:

    # Correct:
    @some.decorator(args)
    def my_function(): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    @some.decorator['method'] + other
    def my_function(): ...
