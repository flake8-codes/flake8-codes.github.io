Forbids to have unreachable code.

What is unreachable code? It is some lines of code that cannot be
executed by python's interpreter.

This is probably caused by `return` or `raise` statements. However, we
can not cover 100% of truly unreachable code by this rule. This happens
due to the dynamic nature of python. For example, detecting that `1 /
some_value` would sometimes raise an exception is too complicated and is
out of the scope of this rule.

## Reasoning
Having dead code in your project is an indicator that you do not
care about your code base at all. It dramatically reduces code
quality and readability. It also demotivates team members.

## Solution
Delete any unreachable code you have. Or refactor it, if this
happens by your mistake.

## Example

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        print('This line is reachable, all good')
        return 5
    
    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        return 5
        print('This line is unreachable')
