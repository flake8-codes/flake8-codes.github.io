Forbid empty comments.

Empty comments are only allowed in between valid comments.

Reasoning:
    Empty comments that do not help formatting should be excluded.

Solution:
    Remove the empty comments.

Example::

    # Correct:

    # First line
    #
    # Samples:
    # One
    # Two
    my_var = 1

    # Wrong:

    #
    my_var = 1
