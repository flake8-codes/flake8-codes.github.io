title: 'Found too high module cognitive complexity: _'
---

Forbids to have modules with too high average cognitive complexity.

## Reasoning
Modules with lots of functions might hide cognitive complexity
inside many small and relatevely simple functions.

## Solution
Rewrite your code to be simplier. Or use several modules.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-cognitive-average`. Default:
`MAX_COGNITIVE_AVERAGE`
