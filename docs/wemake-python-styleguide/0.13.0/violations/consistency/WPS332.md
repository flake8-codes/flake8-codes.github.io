title: Found implicit ternary expression
---

Forbids to have implicit ternary expressions.

## Reasoning
This is done for consistency and readability reasons. We believe
that explicit ternary is better for readability. This also allows
you to identify hidden conditionals in your code.

## Solution
Refactor to use explicit ternary, or `if` condition.

## Example

    # Correct:
    some = one if cond() else two
    
    # Wrong:
    some = cond() and one or two
