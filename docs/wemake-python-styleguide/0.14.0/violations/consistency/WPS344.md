internalName: ZeroDivisionViolation
title: Found explicit zero division
---

Forbids to explicitly divide by zero.

## Reasoning
This will just throw `ZeroDivisionError` in case that's what you
need: just throw it. No need to use undefined meth behaviours. Or it
might be just a typo / mistake, then fix it.

## Solution
Use `ZeroDivisionError` or fix your number not to be `0`.

## Example

    # Correct:
    raise ZeroDivisionError()
    
    # Wrong:
    1 / 0
