Forbids to pass booleans as non-keyword parameters.

## Reasoning
Passing boolean as regular positional parameters is very
non-descriptive. It is almost impossible to tell, what does this
parameter means. And you almost always have to look up the
implementation to tell what is going on. The only exception from
this rule is passing booleans as non-keyword argument when it is the
only passed argument.

## Solution
Pass booleans as keywords only. This will help you to save extra
context on what's going on.

## Example

    # Correct:
    UserRepository.update(True)
    UsersRepository.add(user, cache=True)
    
    # Wrong:
    UsersRepository.add(user, True)
