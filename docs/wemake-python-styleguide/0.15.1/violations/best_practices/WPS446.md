Forbid approximate constants.

## Reasoning
Some constants are already defined. No need to write them again, use
existing values. We just compare numbers as strings and raise this
violation when they start with the same chars.

## Solution
Use pre-defined constants.

## Example

    # Correct:
    from math import pi
    random_number = 3.15
    too_short = 3.1
    
    # Wrong:
    pi = 3.14
