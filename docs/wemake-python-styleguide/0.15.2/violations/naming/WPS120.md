Forbid trailing `_` for names that do not need it.

  - Reasoning:  
    We use trailing underscore for a reason: to indicate that this name
    shadows a built-in or keyword. So, when overusing this feature for
    general names: it just harms readability of your program.

  - Solution:  
    Rename your variable not to contain trailing underscores.

This rule checks: variables, attributes, functions, methods, and
classes.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class_ = SomeClass
    list_ = []
    
    # Wrong:
    some_variable_ = 1
