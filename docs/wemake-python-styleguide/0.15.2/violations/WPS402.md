{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid too many `# noqa` comments.

We count them on a per-module basis.

Reasoning: Having too many `# noqa` comments makes your code less
readable and indicates that there's something wrong with it.

Solution: Refactor your code to match our style. Or use a config file to
switch off some checks.

Configuration: This rule is configurable with `--max-noqa-comments`.
Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_NOQA_COMMENTS') }}
