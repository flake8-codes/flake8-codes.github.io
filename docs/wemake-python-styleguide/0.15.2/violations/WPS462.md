title: Wrong multiline string usage
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Frobids direct usage of multiline strings.

Multiline strings are only allowed in docstrings or assignments to
variables.

  - Reasoning:  
    Direct usage of multiline strings is not readable. One should not
    depend on the current indentation, e.g. in comparisons or function
    calls.

  - Solution:  
    Assign a multiline string to a variable.

Example:

    # Correct:
    multiline = """
        abc
        abc
    """
    
    # Wrong:
    function("""
        abc
        abc
    """)
