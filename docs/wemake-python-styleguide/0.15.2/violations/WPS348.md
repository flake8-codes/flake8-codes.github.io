title: Found a line that starts with a dot

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid starting lines with a dot.

  - Reasoning:  
    We enforce strict consistency rules about how to break lines. We
    also enforce strict rules about multi-line parameters. Starting new
    lines with the dot means that this rule is broken.

  - Solution:  
    Use `()` to break lines in a complex expression.

Example:

    # Correct:
    some = MyModel.objects.filter(
        ...,
    ).exclude(
        ...,
    ).annotate(
        ...,
    )
    
    # Wrong
    some = (
        MyModel.objects.filter(...)
            .exclude(...)
            .annotate(...)
    )
