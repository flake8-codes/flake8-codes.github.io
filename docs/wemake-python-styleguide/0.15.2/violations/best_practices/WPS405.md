title: Found wrong for loop variable definition
---

Forbid anything other than `ast.Name` to define loop variables.

  - Reasoning:  
    When defining a `for` loop with attributes, indexes, calls, or any
    other nodes it does dirty things inside.

  - Solution:  
    Use regular `ast.Name` variables. Or tuple of `ast.Name` variables.
    Star names are also fine.

Example:

    # Correct:
    for person in database.people():
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for context['person'] in database.people():
        ...
