title: Found not a tuple used as an argument
---

Require tuples as arguments for certain functions.

## Reasoning
For some functions, it is better to use tuples instead of another
iterable types (list, sets,...) as arguments.

## Solution
Use tuples as arguments.

Example:

    # Correct:
    a = frozenset((2,))
    
    # Wrong:
    a = frozenset([2])
