title: 'Found an unnecessary use of a raw string: _'
---

Forbid the use of raw strings when there is no backslash in the string.

## Reasoning
Raw string are only needed when dealing with `\` in the string.

## Solution
Do not prefix the string with `r`. Use a normal string instead.

## Example

    # Correct:
    r'This is a correct use \n'
    
    # Wrong:
    r'This string should not be prefixed with r.'
