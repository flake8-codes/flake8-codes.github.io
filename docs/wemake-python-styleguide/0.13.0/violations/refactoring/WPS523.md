title: Found incorrectly swapped variables
---

Forbids unpythonic swap variables.

We check for `a = b; b = a` sequences.

## Reasoning
This looks like a failed attempt to swap.

## Solution
Use standard way to swap two variables.

## Example

    # Correct:
    a, b = b, a
    
    # Wrong:
    a = b
    b = a
    
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
