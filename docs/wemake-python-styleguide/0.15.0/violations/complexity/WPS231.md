title: 'Found function with too much cognitive complexity: _'
---

Forbid functions with too much cognitive complexity.

## Reasoning
People are not great at reading and interpreting code in their
heads. That's why code with a lot of nested loops, conditions,
exceptions handlers, and context managers is hard to read and
understand.

## Solution
Rewrite your code to be simpler. Use flat structures and conditions,
remove nested loops.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-cognitive-score`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_COGNITIVE_SCORE') }}
