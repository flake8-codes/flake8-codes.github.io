code: WPS433
internalName: StaticMethodViolation
title: Found using @staticmethod
---

Forbids to use `@staticmethod` decorator.

## Reasoning
Static methods are not required to be inside the class. Because they
even do not have access to the current instance.

## Solution
Use instance methods, `@classmethod`, or functions instead.
