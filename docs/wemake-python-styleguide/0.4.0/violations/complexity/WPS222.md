title: 'Found a condition with too much logic: _'
---

Forbids to have conditions with too many logical operators.

## Reasoning
When reading through the complex conditions you will fail to
understand all the possible branches. And you will end up putting
debug breakpoint on this line just to figure out how it works.

## Solution
We can reduce the complexity of a single `if` by doing two things:
creating new variables or creating nested `if` statements. Both of
these actions will trigger other complexity checks.

We only check `if` and `while` nodes for this type of complexity. We
check `if` nodes inside list comprehensions and ternary expressions.

We count `and` and `or` keywords as conditions.

## Example

    # The next line has 2 conditions:
    if x_coord > 1 and x_coord < 10: ...

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-conditions`. Default:
`MAX_CONDITIONS`
