Forbid overly complex annotations.

Annotation complexity is maximum annotation nesting level. Example:
`` `List[int] `` has complexity of 2 and `` `Tuple[List[Optional[str]],
int] `` has complexity of 4.

  - Reasoning:  
    Overly complex annotations make your types unreadable. And make
    developers afraid of types.

  - Solution:  
    Create type aliases. And use them a lot\!

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `` `--max-annotation-complexity ``.
    Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_ANN_COMPLEXITY') }}
