title: Found an unnecessary blank line before a bracket
---

Forbid useless blank lines before and after brackets.

## Reasoning
We do this for consistency.

## Solution
Remove blank lines from the start and from the end of a collection.

## Example

    # Correct:
    arr = [
        1,
        2,
    ]
    
    # Wrong:
    arr = [
    
        1,
        2,
    
    ]
