Forbid imports like ``import os.path``.

Reasoning:
    There are too many ways to import something.
    We should pick one style and stick to it.
    We have decided to use the readable one.

Solution:
    Refactor your import statement.

Example::

    # Correct:
    from os import path

    # Wrong:
    import os.path
