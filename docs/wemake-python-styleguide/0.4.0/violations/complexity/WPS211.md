title: 'Found too many arguments: _'
---

Forbids to have too many arguments for a function or method.

## Reasoning
This is an indicator of a bad design. When function requires many
arguments it shows that it is required to refactor this piece of
code. It also indicates that function does too many things at once.

## Solution
Split function into several functions. Then it will be easier to use
them.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-arguments`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_ARGUMENTS') }}
