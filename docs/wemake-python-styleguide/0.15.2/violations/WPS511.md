Forbid multiple `` `isinstance `` calls on the same variable.

  - Reasoning:  
    The best practice is to use `` `isinstance `` with tuple as the
    second argument, instead of multiple conditions joined with
    `` `or ``.

  - Solution:  
    Use tuple of types as the second argument.

Example:

    # Correct:
    isinstance(some, (int, float))
    
    # Wrong:
    isinstance(some, int) or isinstance(some, float)
