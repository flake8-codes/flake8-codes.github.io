title: Found incorrect `yield from` target
---


Forbid ``yield from`` with several nodes.

We allow to ``yield from`` tuples,
names, attributes, calls, and subscripts.

Reasoning:
    We enforce consistency when yielding values
    from tuple instead of any other types.
    It also might be an error when you try to ``yield from`` something
    that is not iterable.

Solution:
    Use allowed node types with ``yield from``.

Example::

    # Correct:
    yield from (1, 2, 3)
    yield from some

    # Wrong:
    yield from [1, 2, 3]
