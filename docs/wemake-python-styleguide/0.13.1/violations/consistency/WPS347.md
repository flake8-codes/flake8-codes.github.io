title: 'Found vague import that may cause confusion: _'
---

Forbids imports that may cause confusion outside of the module.

Names that we forbid to import: - Common names like `dumps` and `loads`
- Names starting with `to_` and `from_` - Too short names like `Q` or
`F`, but we are fine with `_`

## Reasoning
See `datetime.*` in code? You know that it's from datetime. See
`BaseView` in a Django project? You know where it is from. See
`loads`? It can be anything: `yaml`, `toml`, `json`, etc. We are
also enforcing consitency with our naming too-short rules here.

See {{ wps.constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.VAGUE_IMPORTS_BLACKLIST') }} for
the full list of bad import names.

## Example

    # Correct:
    import json
    json.loads(content)
    
    # Wrong:
    from json import loads
    loads(content)
