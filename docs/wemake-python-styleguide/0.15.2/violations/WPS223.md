{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid too many `elif` branches.

We use {{ macros.wps_constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAX_ELIFS') }} as a default
value.

  - Reasoning:  
    This rule is specifically important because many `elif` branches
    indicates a complex flow in your design: you are reimplementing
    `switch` in python.

  - Solution:  
    There are different design patterns to use instead. For example, you
    can use an interface that just calls a specific method without `if`.
    Another option is to separate your `if` into multiple functions.
