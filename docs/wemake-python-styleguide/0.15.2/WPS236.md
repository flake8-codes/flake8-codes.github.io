title: 'Found too many variables used to unpack a tuple: {0}'
---


Forbid using too many variables to unpack a tuple.

Reasoning:
    The order and meaning are hard to remember.

Solution:
    If you have more than 2 values in a tuple, consider using
    ``typing.NamedTuple`` or a dataclass instead.

Example::

    # Correct:
    result = foo()

    # Wrong:
    a, b, c, d, e = foo()

Configuration:
    This rule is configurable with ``--max-tuple-unpack-length``.
    Default:
    :str:`wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_TUPLE_UNPACK_LENGTH`
