Forbid ``yield`` keyword inside comprehensions.

This is a ``SyntaxError`` starting from ``python3.8``.

Reasoning:
    Having the ``yield`` keyword inside comprehensions is error-prone.
    You can shoot yourself in the foot by
    an inaccurate usage of this feature.

Solution:
    Use regular ``for`` loops with ``yield`` keywords
    or create a separate generator function.

Example::

    # Wrong:
    list((yield letter) for letter in 'ab')
    # Will resilt in: ['a', None, 'b', None]

    list([(yield letter) for letter in 'ab'])
    # Will result in: ['a', 'b']
