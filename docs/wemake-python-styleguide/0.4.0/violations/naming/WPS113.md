code: WPS113
internalName: SameAliasImportViolation
title: 'Found same alias import: _'
---

Forbids to use the same alias as the original name in imports.

## Reasoning
Why would you even do this in the first place?

## Example

    # Correct:
    from os import path
    
    # Wrong:
    from os import path as path

<div class="versionadded">

0.1.0

</div>

  - Note:  
    Returns Z113 as error code
