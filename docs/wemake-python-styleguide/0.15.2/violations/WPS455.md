title: Found non-trivial expression as an argument for "except"
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids using non-trivial expressions as a parameter for `except`.

  - Reasoning:  
    Expressions used as an argument for `except` could be hard to read
    and hide real list of exceptions being expected to occur in the
    outlined code block.

  - Solution:  
    Use separate `except` blocks for each exception or provide a tuple
    of exception classes.

Example:

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    except ValueError:
        ...
    except TypeError:
        ...
    
    try:
        ...
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    except TypeError or ValueError:
        ...
