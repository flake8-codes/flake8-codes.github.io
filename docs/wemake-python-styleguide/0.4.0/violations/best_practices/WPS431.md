Forbids to use nested classes.

## Reasoning
Nested classes are really hard to manage. You can not even create an
instance of this class in many cases. Testing them is also really
hard.

## Solution
Just write flat classes, there's no need nest them. If you are
nesting classes inside a function for parametrization, then you will
probably need to use different design (or metaclasses).

See `NESTED_CLASSES_WHITELIST`
for the full list of whitelisted names.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class Some(object): ...
    class Other(object): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Some(object):
        class Inner(object):
            ...
