title: 'Found alphabet as strings: _'
---

Forbid to use alphabet as a string.

## Reasoning
Some constants are already defined. No need to write them again, use
existing values. We just compare strings and raise this violation
when they have exactly the same chars.

## Solution
Use pre-defined constants.

## Example

    # Correct:
    import string
    UPPERCASE_ALPH = string.ascii_uppercase
    LOWERCASE_ALPH = string.ascii_lowercase
    
    # Wrong:
    GUESS_MY_NAME = "abcde...WXYZ"
    UPPERCASE_ALPH = "ABCD...WXYZ"
    LOWERCASE_ALPH = "abcd...wxyz"
