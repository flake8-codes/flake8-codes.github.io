title: Found wrong `for` loop variable definition
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid anything other than `ast.Name` to define loop variables.

Reasoning: When defining a `for` loop with attributes, indexes, calls,
or any other nodes it does dirty things inside.

Solution: Use regular `ast.Name` variables. Or tuple of `ast.Name`
variables. Star names are also fine.

Example::

    # Correct:
    for person in database.people():
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for context['person'] in database.people():
        ...
