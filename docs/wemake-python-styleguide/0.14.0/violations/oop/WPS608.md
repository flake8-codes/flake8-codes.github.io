title: 'Found incorrect super() call: _'

Forbids to use `super()` with parameters or outside of methods.

## Reasoning
`super()` is a very special function. It implicitly relies on the
context where it is used and parameters passed to it. So, we should
be very careful with parameters and context.

## Solution
Use `super()` without arguments and only inside methods.

## Example

    # Correct:
    super().__init__()
    
    # Wrong:
    super(ClassName, self).__init__()
