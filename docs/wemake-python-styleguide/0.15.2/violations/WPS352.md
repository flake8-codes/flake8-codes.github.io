title: Found multiline loop
---

Forbid multiline loops.

  - Reasoning:  
    It decreased the readability of the code.

  - Solution:  
    Use single line loops and create new variables in case you need to
    fit too many logic inside the loop definition.

Example:

    # Correct:
    for num in some_function(arg1, arg2):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for num in range(
        arg1,
        arg2,
    ):
        ...
