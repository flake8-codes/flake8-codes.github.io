title: Found multiple assign targets
---

Forbids to have multiple assignments on the same line.

## Reasoning
Multiple assignments on the same line might not do what you think
they do. They can also grown pretty long. And you will not notice
the rising complexity of your code.

## Solution
Use separate lines for each assignment.

## Example

    # Correct:
    a = 1
    b = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    a = b = 1
