title: Found consecutive `yield` expressions
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid consecutive `yield` expressions.

We raise this violation when we find at least two consecutive `yield`
expressions.

  - Reasoning:  
    One can write multiple `yield` nodes in a row. That's inconsistent.
    Because we have `yield from` form.

  - Solution:  
    It can be easily changed to `yield from (...)` format.
