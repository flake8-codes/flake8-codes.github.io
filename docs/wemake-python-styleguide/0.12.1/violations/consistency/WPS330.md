title: 'Found unnecessary operator: _'
---

Forbids the use of unnecessary operators in your code.

You can write: `5.4` and `+5.4`. There's no need to use the second
version. Similarly `--5.4`, `---5.4`, `not not foo`, and `~~42` contain
unnecessary operators.

## Reasoning
This is done for consistency reasons.

## Solution
Omit unnecessary operators.

## Example

    # Correct:
    profit = 3.33
    profit = -3.33
    inverse = ~5
    complement = not foo
    
    # Wrong:
    profit = +3.33
    profit = --3.33
    profit = ---3.33
    number = ~~42
    bar = not not foo
