internalName: WalrusViolation
title: Found walrus operator
---

Forbid local variable that are only used in `return` statements.

This violation can only be thrown on `python3.8+`.

## Reasoning
Code with `:=` is hardly readable. It has big problems with scoping
and reading order. And it can lead to a huge mess inside your code.
Python is not expression-based.

## Solution
Don't use fancy stuff, use good old assignments.

Example:

    # Correct:
    some = call()
    if some:
        print(some)
    
    # Wrong:
    if some := call():
        print(some)
