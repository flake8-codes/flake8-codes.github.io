code: 402
title: 'Found `noqa` comments overuse: {0}'
---

Forbid too many `# noqa` comments.

We count them on a per-module basis.

  - Reasoning:  
    Having too many `# noqa` comments makes your code less readable and
    indicates that there's something wrong with it.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your code to match our style. Or use a config file to
    switch off some checks.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-noqa-comments`. Default:
    `python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_NOQA_COMMENTS`
