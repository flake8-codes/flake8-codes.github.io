{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids to use getters and setters in objects.

Reasoning: Python does not need this abstraction.

Solution: Either use `@property` or make the attribute public and change
it directly.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Example(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self._attribute = None
    
    # Wrong:
    class Example(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.attribute = None
    
        def set_attribute(self):
            ...
    
        def get_attribute(self, value):
            ...
