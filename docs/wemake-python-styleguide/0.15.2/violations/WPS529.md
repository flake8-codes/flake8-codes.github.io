title: Found implicit `.get()` dict usage
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid implicit `.get()` dict method.

  - Reasoning:  
    When using `in` with a dict key it is hard to keep the code clean.
    It is more convenient to use `.get()` and check for `None` later.

  - Solution:  
    Use `.get()` with the key you need. Check for `None` in case you
    need it, or just act with the default value of the same type.

Example:

    # Correct:
    value = collection.get(key)
    if value is not None:
        print(value)
    
    # Wrong:
    if key in collection:
        print(collection[key])
