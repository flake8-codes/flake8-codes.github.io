These checks limit the Python's inconsistency.

We can do the same things differently in Python. For example, there are
three ways to format a string. There are several ways to write the same
number.

We like our code to be consistent. It is easier to bare with your code
base if you follow these rules.

So, we choose a single way to do things. It does not mean that we choose
the best way to do it. But, we value consistency more than being 100%
right. And we are ready to suffer all trade-offs that might come.

Once again, these rules are highly subjective. But, we love them.
