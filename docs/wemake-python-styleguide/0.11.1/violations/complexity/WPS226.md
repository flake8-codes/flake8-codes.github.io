title: 'Found string constant over-use: _'
---

Forbids to over-use string constants.

## Reasoning
When some string is used more than several time in your code, it
probably means that this string is a meaningful constant. And should
be treated like one.

## Solution
Deduplicate you string usages by defining new functions or
constants.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-string-usages`. Default:
`MAX_STRING_USAGES`
