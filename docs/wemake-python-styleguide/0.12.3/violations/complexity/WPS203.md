Forbids to have modules with too many imported names.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those\!

## Reasoning
Having too many imported names without prefixes is quite expensive.
You have to memorize all the source locations of the imports. And
sometimes it is hard to remember what kind of functions and classes
are already injected into your context.

It is also a questionable design if a single module has a lot of
imports. Why a single module has so many dependencies? So, it
becomes too coupled.

## Solution
Refactor the imports to import a common namespace. Something like
`from package import module` and then use it like
`module.function()`.

Or refactor your code and split the complex module into several
ones.

## Example

    # Correct:
    import module  # 1 imported name
    
    # Wrong:
    from module import func1, func2, ..., funcN  # N imported names

We do not make any differences between `import` and `from ... import
...`.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-imported-names`. Default:
`MAX_IMPORTED_NAMES`
