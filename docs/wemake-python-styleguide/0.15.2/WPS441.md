title: 'Found control variable used after block: {0}'
---


Forbid control variables after the block body.

What we call block control variables:

1. ``for`` loop unpacked variables
2. ``with`` context variables

Reasoning:
    Variables leaking from the blocks can damage your logic.
    It might not contain what you think they contain.

Solution:
    Use names inside the scope they are defined.
    Create new functions to return values in case
    you need to use block variables: when searching for a value, etc.

Example::

    # Correct:
    for my_item in collection:
        print(my_item)

    # Wrong:
    for my_item in collection:
        ...
    print(my_item)
