Forbid meaningless nodes.

Reasoning: Some nodes might be completely useless. They will literally
do nothing. Sometimes they are hard to find, because this situation can
be caused by a recent refactoring or just by accident. This might be
also an overuse of syntax.

Solution: Remove node or make sure it makes sense.

Example::

    # Wrong:
    for number in [1, 2, 3]:
        break
