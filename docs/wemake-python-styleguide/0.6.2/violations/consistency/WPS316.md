title: Found context manager with too many assignments
---

Forbids multiple assignment targets for context managers.

## Reasoning
It is hard to distinguish whether `as` should unpack into tuple, or
we are just using two context managers.

## Solution
Use several context managers. Or explicit brackets.

## Example

    # Correct:
    with open('') as first:
        with second:
            ...
    
    with some_context as (first, second):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    with open('') as first, second:
        ...
