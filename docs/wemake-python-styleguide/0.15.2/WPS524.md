title: Found self assignment  with refactored assignment
---

Forbid misrefactored self assignment.

  - Reasoning:  
    Self assignment does not need to have the same operand on the left
    hand side and on the right hand side.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor you code to use multiple self assignments or fix your code.

Example:

    # Correct:
    test += 1
    test *= 2
    
    # Wrong:
    test += test + 1
