internalName: WrongKeywordConditionViolation
title: 'Found wrong keyword condition: _'
---

Forbids to use exlicit falsly-evaluated conditions with several
keywords.

We check:

  - `ast.While`
  - `ast.Assert`

We only check constants. We do not check variables, attributes, calls,
etc.

## Reasoning
Some conditions clearly tell us that this node won't work correctly.
So, we need to check that we can fix that.

## Solution
Remove the unreachable node, or change the condition item.

## Example

    # Correct:
    assert some_variable
    
    while True:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    assert []
    
    while False:
        ...
