title: Found implicit `yield from` usage

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `yield` inside `for` loop instead of `yield from`.

Reasoning: It is known that `yield from` is a semantically identical to
a `for` loop with a `yield` inside. But, it is way more readable.

Solution: Use `yield from` some iterable directly instead iterating over
it inside a loop and `yield` it one by one.

Example::

    # Correct:
    yield from some()
    
    yield from (
        value[index:index + chunk_size]
        for index in range(0, len(value), chunk_size)
    )
    
    # Wrong:
    for index in chunk:
        yield index
