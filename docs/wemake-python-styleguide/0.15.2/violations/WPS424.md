{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `BaseException` exception.

  - Reasoning:  
    We can silence system exit and keyboard interrupt with this
    exception handler. It is almost the same as raw `except:` block.

  - Solution:  
    Handle `Exception`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, `GeneratorExit`, and
    `SystemExit` separately. Do not use the plain `except:` keyword.

Example:

    # Correct:
    except Exception as ex: ...
    
    # Wrong:
    except BaseException as ex: ...
