title: Found a comprehension with too many `for` statements

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid too many `for` statements within a comprehension.

Reasoning: When reading through the complex comprehension you will fail
to understand it.

Solution: We can reduce the complexity of the comprehension by reducing
the amount of `for` statements. Refactor your code to use several `for`
loops, comprehensions, or different functions.

Example::

    # Wrong:
    ast_nodes = [
        target
        for assignment in top_level_assigns
        for target in assignment.targets
        for _ in range(10)
    ]
