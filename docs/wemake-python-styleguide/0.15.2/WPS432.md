Forbid magic numbers.

What do we call a "magic number"? Well, it is actually any number that
appears in your code out of nowhere. Like `42`. Or `0.32`.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is very hard to remember what these numbers mean. Why were they
    used? Should they ever be changed? Or are they eternal like `3.14`?

  - Solution:  
    Give these numbers a name\! Move them to a separate variable, giving
    more context to the reader. And by moving things into new variables
    you will trigger other complexity checks.

Example:

    # Correct:
    price_in_euro = 3.33  # could be changed later
    total = get_items_from_cart() * price_in_euro
    
    # Wrong:
    total = get_items_from_cart() * 3.33

What are the numbers that we exclude from this check? Any numbers that
are assigned to a variable, array, dictionary, or keyword arguments
inside a function. `int` numbers that are in range `[-10, 10]` and some
other common numbers, that are defined in
:py`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAGIC_NUMBERS_WHITELIST`
