title: Found complex default value
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid complex defaults.

Anything that is not a `` `ast.Name ``, `` `ast.Attribute ``,
`` `ast.Str ``, `ast.NameConstant`, `` `ast.Tuple ``, `` `ast.Bytes ``,
`` `ast.Num `` or `` `ast.Ellipsis `` should be moved out from defaults.

  - Reasoning:  
    It can be tricky. Nothing stops you from making database calls or
    HTTP requests in such expressions. It is also not readable for us.

  - Solution:  
    Move the expression out from default value.

Example:

    # Correct:
    SHOULD_USE_DOCTEST = 'PYFLAKES_DOCTEST' in os.environ
    def __init__(self, with_doctest=SHOULD_USE_DOCTEST):
    
    # Wrong:
    def __init__(self, with_doctest='PYFLAKES_DOCTEST' in os.environ):
