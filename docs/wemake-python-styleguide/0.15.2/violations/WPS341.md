Forbid letters as hex numbers.

  - Reasoning:  
    One can write `0xA` and `0xa` which is inconsistent. This rule
    enforces upper-case letters in hex numbers.

  - Solution:  
    Use uppercase letters in hex numbers.

Example:

    # Correct:
    number = 0xABCDEF
    
    # Wrong:
    number = 0xabcdef
