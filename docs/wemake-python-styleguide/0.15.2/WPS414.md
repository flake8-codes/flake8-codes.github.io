title: Found incorrect unpacking target
---


Forbid tuple unpacking with side-effects.

Reasoning:
    Having unpacking with side-effects is very dirty.
    You might get in serious and very hard-to-debug troubles because of
    this technique so do not use it.

    This includes assigning to attributes, as this results in modifying
    the instance. Every modification should be explicit on it's own line.

Solution:
    Use unpacking only with variables, not any other entities.

Example::

    # Correct:
    reader, writter = call()
    self.reader = reader
    self.writer = writer

    # Wrong:
    first, some_dict['alias'] = some()
    self.reader, self.writer = call()
