title: Found wrong context manager variable definition
---

Forbids to use anything rather than `ast.Name` to define contexts.

## Reasoning
When defining a `with` context managers with attributes, indexes,
calls, or any other nodes it does dirty things inside.

## Solution
Use regular `ast.Name` variables.

## Example

    # Correct:
    with open('README.md') as readme:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    with open('README.md') as files['readme']:
        ...
