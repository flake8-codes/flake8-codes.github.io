title: Found incorrect base class
---

Forbid anything other than a class as a base class.

We only check base classes and not keywords. They can be anything you
need.

## Reasoning
In Python you can specify anything in the base classes slot. In
runtime this expression will be evaluated and executed. We need to
prevent dirty hacks in this field.

## Solution
Use only attributes, names, and types to be your base classes. Use
`annotation` future import in case you use strings in base classes.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class Test(module.ObjectName, MixinName, keyword=True): ...
    class GenericClass(Generic[ValueType]): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test((lambda: object)()): ...
