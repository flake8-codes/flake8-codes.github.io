Forbid explicit unused variables.

Reasoning: While it is ok to define unused variables when you have to,
like when unpacking a tuple, it is totally not ok to define explicit
unusued variables in cases like assignment, function return, exception
handling, or context managers. Why do you need this explicitly unused
variables?

Solution: Remove all unused variables definition.

Example::

    # Correct:
    my_function()
    first, _second = some_tuple()
    print(first)
    
    # Wrong:
    _ = my_function()
    _first, _second = some_tuple()

This rule checks: assigns, context managers, except clauses.
