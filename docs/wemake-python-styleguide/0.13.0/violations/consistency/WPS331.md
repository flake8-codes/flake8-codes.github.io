title: Found local variable that are only used in return statements
---

Forbids local variable that are only used in `return` statements.

## Reasoning
This is done for consistency and more readable source code.

## Solution
Return the expression itself, instead of creating a temporary
variable.

## Example

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        return 1
    
    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        some_value = 1
        return some_value
