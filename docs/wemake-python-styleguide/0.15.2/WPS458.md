Forbids to import from already imported modules.

Reasoning:
    Importing objects from already imported modules is inconsistent
    and error-prone.

Solution:
    Do not import objects from already imported modules or use aliases
    when it cannot be avoided.

Example::

    # Correct:
    import public
    from public.module import FooClass

    import hypothesis
    from hypothesis import strategies as st

    # Wrong:
    from public import utils
    from public.utils import something

    import hypothesis
    from hypothesis import strategies
