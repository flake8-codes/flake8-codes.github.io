title: Found useless continue at the end of the loop
---

Forbids to use meaningless `continue` node in loops.

## Reasoning
Placing this keyword in the end of any loop won't make any
difference to your code. And we prefer not to have meaningless
constructs in our code.

## Solution
Remove useless `continue` node from the loop.

## Example

    # Correct:
    for number in [1, 2, 3]:
        if number < 2:
            continue
        print(number)
    
    # Wrong:
    for number in [1, 2, 3]:
        print(number)
        continue
