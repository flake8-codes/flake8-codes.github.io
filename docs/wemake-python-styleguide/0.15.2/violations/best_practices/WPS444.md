title: Found incorrect keyword condition
---

Forbid explicit falsely-evaluated conditions with several keywords.

We check:

  - `ast.While`
  - `ast.Assert`

We do not check variables, attributes, calls, bool and bin operators,
etc. We forbid constants and some expressions.

## Reasoning
Some conditions tell us that this node won't work correctly. So, we
need to check if we can fix that.

## Solution
Remove the unreachable node, or change the condition item.

## Example

    # Correct:
    assert some_variable
    
    while True:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    assert []
    
    while False:
        ...
