Forbid nested functions.

Reasoning: Nesting functions is bad practice. It is hard to test them
and it is hard to separate them later. People tend to overuse closures,
so it's hard to manage the dataflow.

Solution: Just write flat functions, there's no need to nest them. Pass
parameters as normal arguments, do not use closures until you need them
for decorators or factories.

We also forbid nesting `lambda` and `async` functions.

See
:py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.NESTED_FUNCTIONS_WHITELIST`
for the whole list of whitelisted names.

Example::

    # Correct:
    def do_some(): ...
    def other(): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    def do_some():
        def inner():
            ...
