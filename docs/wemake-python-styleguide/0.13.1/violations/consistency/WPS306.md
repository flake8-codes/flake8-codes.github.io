title: 'Found class without a base class: _'

Forbids to write classes without base classes.

## Reasoning
We just need to decide how to do it. We need a single and unified
rule about base classes. We have decided to stick to the explicit
base class notation.

## Solution
Add a base class.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class Some(object): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Some: ...
