Forbid implicit negative indexes.

Reasoning: There's no need in getting the length of an iterable and then
having a negative offset, when you can specify negative indexes in the
first place.

Solution: Use negative indexes.

Example::

    # Correct:
    some_list[-1]
    
    # Wrong:
    some_list[len(some_list) - 1]
