Forbid `\\` escape sequences inside regular strings.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is hard to read escape sequences inside regular strings, because
    they use `\\` double backslash for a single character escape.

  - Solution:  
    Use raw strings `r''` to rewrite the escape sequence with a `\`
    single backslash.

Example:

    # Correct:
    escaped = [r'\n', '\n']
    
    # Wrong:
    escaped = '\\n'
