Forbid brackets in the wrong position.

Reasoning: You can do bizarre things with bracket positioning in python.
We require all brackets to be consistent.

Solution: Place bracket on the same line, in case of a single line
expression. Or place the bracket on a new line in case of a multi-line
expression.

Example::

    # Correct:
    print([
        1, 2, 3,
    ])
    
    print(
        1,
        2,
    )
    
    def _annotate_brackets(
        tokens: List[tokenize.TokenInfo],
    ) -> TokenLines:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    print([
        1, 2, 3],
    )
    
    print(
        1,
        2)
    
    def _annotate_brackets(
        tokens: List[tokenize.TokenInfo]) -> TokenLines:
        ...

We check round, square, and curly brackets.
