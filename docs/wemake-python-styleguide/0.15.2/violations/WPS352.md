{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid multiline loops.

Reasoning: It decreased the readability of the code.

Solution: Use single line loops and create new variables in case you
need to fit too many logic inside the loop definition.

Example::

    # Correct:
    for num in some_function(arg1, arg2):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for num in range(
        arg1,
        arg2,
    ):
        ...
