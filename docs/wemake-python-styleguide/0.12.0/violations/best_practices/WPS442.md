Forbids to shadow variables from outer scopes.

We check function, method, and module scopes. While we do not check
class scope. Because class level constants are not available via regular
name, and they are scope to `ClassName.var_name`.

## Reasoning
Shadowing can lead you to a big pile of strage and unexpected bugs.

## Solution
Use different names and do not allow scoping.

## Example

    # Correct:
    def test(): ...
    
    def other():
        test1 = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    def test(): ...
    
    def other():
        test = 1  # shadows ``test()` function
