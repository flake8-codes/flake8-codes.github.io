title: Found incorrect `for` loop iter type

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid wrong `for` loop iter targets.

We forbid to use:

  - Lists and list comprehensions
  - Sets and set comprehensions
  - Dicts and dict comprehensions
  - Generator expressions
  - Empty tuples

Reasoning: Using lists, dicts, and sets do not make much sense. You can
use tuples instead. Using comprehensions implicitly creates a two level
loop, that is hard to read and deal with.

Solution: Use tuples to create explicit iterables for `for` loops. In
case you are using a comprehension, create a new variable.

Example::

    # Correct:
    for person in ('Kim', 'Nick'):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    for person in ['Kim', 'Nick']:
        ...
