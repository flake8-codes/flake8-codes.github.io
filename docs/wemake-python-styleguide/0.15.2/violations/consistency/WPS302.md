title: 'Found unicode string prefix: _'

Forbid `u` string prefix.

## Reasoning
We haven't needed this prefix since `python2`, but it is still
possible to find it in a codebase.

## Solution
Remove this prefix.

Example:

    # Correct:
    nickname = 'sobolevn'
    file_contents = b'aabbcc'
    
    # Wrong:
    nickname = u'sobolevn'
