{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid placing too many `return` statements in a function.

  - Reasoning:  
    When there are too many `return` keywords, functions are hard to
    test. They are also hard to read and hard to change and keep
    everything inside your head at once.

  - Solution:  
    Change your design. Split the function into multiple functions.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-returns`. Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_RETURNS') }}
