title: Found negated condition
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid negated conditions together with `else` clause.

  - Reasoning:  
    It easier to read and name regular conditions. Not negated ones.

  - Solution:  
    Move actions from the negated `if` condition to the `else`
    condition.

Example:

    # Correct:
    if some == 1:
         ...
    else:
         ...
    
    if not some:
         ...
    
    if not some:
        ...
    elif other:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if not some:
         ...
    else:
         ...
