title: 'Found too many assert statements: _'
---

Forbid placing too many `assert` statements into a function.

## Reasoning
When there are too many `assert` keywords, functions are starting to
get really complex. It might indicate that your tests or contracts
are too big.

## Solution
Create rich `assert` statements, use higher-level contracts, or
create special guard functions.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-asserts`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_ASSERTS') }}
