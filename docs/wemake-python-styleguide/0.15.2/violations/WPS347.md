{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid imports that may cause confusion outside of the module.

Names that we forbid to import:

  - Common names like `` `dumps `` and `` `loads ``
  - Names starting with `` `to_ `` and `` `from_ ``
  - Too short names like `` `Q `` or `` `F ``, but we are fine with
    `` `_ ``

<!-- end list -->

  - Reasoning:  
    See `` `datetime.* `` in code? You know that it's from datetime. See
    `` `BaseView `` in a Django project? You know where it is from. See
    `` `loads ``? It can be anything: `` `yaml ``, `` `toml ``,
    `` `json ``, etc. We are also enforcing consistency with our naming
    too-short rules here.

  - Solution:  
    Use package level imports or import aliases.

See :py`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.VAGUE_IMPORTS_BLACKLIST` for
the full list of bad import names.

Example:

    # Correct:
    import json
    import dumps  # package names are not checked
    from json import loads as json_loads
    
    # Wrong:
    from json import loads
