Forbid direct magic attributes and methods.

Reasoning: When using direct magic attributes or method it means that
you are doing something wrong. Magic methods are not suited to be
directly called or accessed.

Solution: Use special syntax constructs that will call underlying magic
methods.

Example::

    # Correct:
    super().__init__()
    
    # Wrong:
    2..__truediv__(2)
    d.__delitem__('a')

Note, that it is possible to use direct magic attributes with `self`,
`cls`, and `super()` as base names. We allow this because a lot of
internal logic relies on these methods.
