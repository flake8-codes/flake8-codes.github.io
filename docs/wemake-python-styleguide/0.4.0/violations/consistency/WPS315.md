internalName: ObjectInBaseClassesListViolation
title: Founded extra object in parent classes list
---

Forbid extra `object` in parent classes list.

## Reasoning
We should allow object only when we explicitly use it as a single
parent class. When there is an other class or there are multiple
parents - we should not allow it for the consistency reasons.

## Solution
Remove extra `object` parent class from the list.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class SomeClassName(object): ...
    class SomeClassName(FirstParentClass, SecondParentClass): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class SomeClassName(FirstParentClass, SecondParentClass, object): ...

<div class="versionadded">

0.3.0

</div>
