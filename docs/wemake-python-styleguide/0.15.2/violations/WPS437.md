Forbid protected attributes and methods.

Reasoning: When using protected attributes and method we break a
contract that authors of this class enforce. This way we are not
respecting encapsulation and it may break our code at any moment.

Solution: Do not use protected attributes and methods. Respect the
encapsulation.

Example::

    # Correct:
    self._protected = 1
    cls._hidden_method()
    some.public()
    super()._protected()
    
    # Wrong:
    print(some._protected)
    instance._hidden()
    self.container._internal = 10

Note, that it is possible to use protected attributes with `self`,
`cls`, and `super()` as base names. We allow this so you can create and
use protected attributes and methods inside the class context. This is
how protected attributes should be used.
