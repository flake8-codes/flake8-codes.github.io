title: Found inconsistent `yield` statement
---


Enforce consistent ``yield`` statements.

Rules are:
1. if any ``yield`` has a value, all ``yield`` nodes should have a value

This rule respects ``mypy`` style of placing ``yield`` statements.
There should be no conflict with these two checks.

Reasoning:
    This is done for pure consistency and readability of your code.
    Eventually, this rule may also find some bugs in your code.

Solution:
    Add or remove values from the ``yield`` statements
    to make them consistent.

Example::

    # Correct:
    def function():
        if some:
            yield 2
        yield 1

    # Wrong:
    def function():
        if some:
            yield
        yield 1
