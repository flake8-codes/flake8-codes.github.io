title: Found incorrect order of methods in a class
---

Forbids to have incorrect order of methods inside a class.

We follow the same ordering:

  - `__new__`
  - `__init__`
  - public and magic methods
  - protected methods
  - private methods (we discourage using them)

We follow "Newspaper order" where the most important things come first.

## Reasoning
It is hard to read classes where API declarations are bloated with
implementation details. We need to see the important stuff first,
then we can go deeper in case we are interested.

## Solution
Reorder methods inside your class to match our format.
