title: Found incorrect base class

Forbids to have methods without any arguments.

## Reasoning
In Python you can specify anything in the base classes slot. In

## Solution
Use only raw names to set your base classes.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class Test(module.ObjectName, MixinName, keyword=True): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test((lambda: object)()): ...
