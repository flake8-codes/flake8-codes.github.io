title: 'Found consecutive underscores name: {0}'

Forbid using more than one consecutive underscore in variable names.

Reasoning:
    This is done to gain extra readability.
    This naming rule already exists for module names.

Example::

    # Correct:
    some_value = 5
    __magic__ = 5

    # Wrong:
    some__value = 5

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, and methods.
