title: Found missing empty line between coding magic comment and code
---

Enforces to have an extra empty line after the `coding` comment.

## Reasoning
This is done for pure consistency.

## Solution
Add an empty line between `coding` magic comment and your code.

## Example

    # Correct:
    # coding: utf-8
    
    SOME_VAR = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    # coding: utf-8
    SOME_VAR = 1
