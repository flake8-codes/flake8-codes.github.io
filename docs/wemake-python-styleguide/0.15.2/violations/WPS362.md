Forbid assignment to a subscript slice.

Reasoning:
    Assignment to a slice may lead to a list changing its size
    implicitly and strangely which makes it hard to spot bugs.

Solution:
    Use explicit index assignment in place of slice assignment.

Why you may disable or inline-ignore this rule?

The quite common and useful example which violates this rule
is inplace list replacement via ``[:]`` - this helps
to keep the same object reference while it content could be completely
erased or replaced with the new one.

One more thing: slice assignment is the only way
for inplace array multiple replacement when you need that.

Example::

    # Correct:
    a[5] = 1

    # Wrong:
    a[1:3] = [1, 2]
    a[slice(1)] = [1, 3]
