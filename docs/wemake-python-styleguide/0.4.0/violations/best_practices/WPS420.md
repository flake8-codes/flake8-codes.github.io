code: WPS420
internalName: WrongKeywordViolation
title: 'Found wrong keyword: _'
---

Forbids to use some keywords from `python`.

## Reasoning
We believe that some keywords are anti-patterns. They promote
bad-practices like `global` and `pass`, or just not user-friendly
like `del`.

## Solution
Solutions differ from keyword to keyword. `pass` should be replaced
with docstring or `contextlib.suppress`. `del` should be replaced
with specialized methods like `.pop()`. `global` and `nonlocal`
usages should be refactored.

## Example

    # Wrong:
    pass
    del
    nonlocal
    global
