title: Found constant comparison
---

Forbid comparing between two literals.

## Reasoning
When two constants are compared it is typically an indication of a
mistake, since the Boolean value of the comparison, will always be
the same.

## Solution
Remove the constant comparison and any associated dead code.

Example:

    # Wrong:
    if 60 * 60 < 1000:
        do_something()
    else:
        do_something_else()
    
    # Correct:
    do_something_else()
