title: Found `%` string formatting

Forbid ``%`` formatting on strings.

We check for string formatting. We try not to issue false positives.
It is better for us to ignore a real (but hard to detect) case,
then marking a valid one as incorrect.

Internally we check for this pattern in string definitions::

    %[(name)] [flags] [width] [.precision] [{h | l}] type

This is a ``C`` format specification.
Related to :class:`~FormattedStringViolation` and solves the same problem.

Reasoning:
    You must use a single formatting method across your project.

Solution:
    We enforce to use string ``.format()`` method for this task.

Example::

    # Correct:
    'some string', 'your name: {0}', 'data: {data}'

    # Wrong:
    'my name is: %s', 'data: %(data)d'

It might be a good idea to disable this rule
and switch to ``flake8-pep3101`` in case your project
has a lot of false-positives due
to some specific string chars that uses ``%`` a lot.
