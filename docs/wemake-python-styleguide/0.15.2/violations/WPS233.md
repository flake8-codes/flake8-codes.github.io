title: 'Found call chain that is too long: {0}'
---

Forbid call chains that are too long.

  - Reasoning:  
    Call chains that are too long are overcomplicated and indicators of
    bad API design.

  - Solution:  
    Split the expression into variables, functions or classes. Refactor
    the API to allow higher-level access to functions.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-call-level`. Default:
    `python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_CALL_LEVEL`
