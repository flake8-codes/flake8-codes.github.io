title: Found yield inside comprehension

Forbids to have `yield` keyword inside comprehensions.

## Reasoning
Having the `yield` keyword inside comprehensions is error-prone. You
can shoot yourself in a foot by an inaccurate usage of this feature.

## Solution
Use regular `for` loops with `yield` keywords. Or create a separate
generator function.

## Example

    # Wrong:
    >>> list((yield letter) for letter in 'ab')
    ['a', None, 'b', None]
    
    >>> list([(yield letter) for letter in 'ab'])
    ['a', 'b']
