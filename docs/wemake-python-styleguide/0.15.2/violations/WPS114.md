Forbid names with underscored numbers pattern.

Reasoning:
    This is done for consistency in naming.

Solution:
    Do not put an underscore between text and numbers, that is confusing.
    Rename your variable or modules do not include underscored numbers.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes,
functions, method, and classes.
Please, note that putting an underscore that replaces ``-`` in some
names between numbers are fine, example: ``ISO-123-456`` would become
``iso123_456``.

Example::

    # Correct:
    star_wars_episode2 = 'awesome!'
    iso123_456 = 'some data'

    # Wrong:
    star_wars_episode_2 = 'not so awesome'
    iso_123_456 = 'some data'
