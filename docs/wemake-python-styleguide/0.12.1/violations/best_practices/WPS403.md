Forbids to use too many `# pragma: no cover` comments.

We count it on a per-module basis. We use
{{ wps.constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAX_NO_COVER_COMMENTS') }} as a default
value.

## Reasoning
Having too many `# pragma: no cover` comments clearly indicates that
there's something wrong with it. Moreover, it makes your tests
useless, since they do not cover a big partion of your code.

## Solution
Refactor your code to much the style. Or use a config file to switch
off some checks.
