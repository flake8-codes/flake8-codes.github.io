title: Found conditional that always evaluates the same
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid using `if` statements that use invalid conditionals.

Reasoning: When invalid conditional arguments are used it is typically
an indication of a mistake, since the value of the conditional result
will always be the same.

Solution: Remove the conditional and any associated dead code.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if value is True: ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if True: ...
