title: Found explicit string concatenation
---


Forbid explicit string concatanation in favour of ``.format`` method.

However, we still allow multiline string concatanation
as a way to write long strings that does not fit the 80-chars rule.

Reasoning:
    When formatting strings one must use ``.format``
    and not any other formatting methods like ``%``, ``+``, or ``f``.
    This is done for consistency reasons.

Solution:
    Join strings together if you can, or use ``.format`` method.

Example::

    # Correct:
    x = 'ab: {0}'.format(some_data)

    # Wrong:
    x = 'a' + 'b: ' + some_data
