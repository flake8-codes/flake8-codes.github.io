title: 'Found line with high Jones Complexity: _'

Forbids to have complex lines.

We are using Jones Complexity algorithm to count complexity. What is
Jones Complexity? It is a simple yet powerful method to count the number
of `ast` nodes per line. If the complexity of a single line is higher
than a threshold, then an error is raised.

What nodes do we count? All except the following:

1.  modules
2.  function and classes, since they are checked differently
3.  type annotations, since they do not increase the complexity

<!-- end list -->

## Reasoning
Having a complex line indicates that you somehow managed to put too
much logic inside a single line. At some point in time, you will no
longer be able to understand what this line means and what it does.

## Solution
Split a single line into several lines: by creating new variables,
statements or functions. Note, this might trigger new complexity
issues. With this technique, a single new node in a line might
trigger a complex refactoring process including several modules.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-line-complexity`. Default:
`MAX_LINE_COMPLEXITY`
