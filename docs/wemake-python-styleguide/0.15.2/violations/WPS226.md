{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid the overuse of string constants.

We allow to use strings without any restrictions as annotations for
variables, arguments, return values, and class attributes.

  - Reasoning:  
    When some string is used more than several time in your code, it
    probably means that this string is a meaningful constant and should
    be treated like one.

  - Solution:  
    Deduplicate you string usages by defining new functions or
    constants.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `` `--max-string-usages ``. Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_STRING_USAGES') }}
