Forbid writing classes without base classes.

Please, note that this rule has nothing to do with `python2`. We care
only about consistency here.

Reasoning: We just need to decide how to do it. We need a single and
unified rule about base classes. We have decided to stick to the
explicit base class notation. Why? Because it is consistent with other
use-cases. When we have a base class `A`, we write `class MyClass(A):`.
When we have no base class, we have an implicit `object` base class. So,
we still use the same syntax: `class MyClass(object):`.

Solution: Add a base class.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Some(object): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Some: ...
