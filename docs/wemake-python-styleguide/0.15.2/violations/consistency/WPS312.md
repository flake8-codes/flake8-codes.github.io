title: Found comparison of a variable to itself
---

Forbid comparisons of a variable to itself.

## Reasoning
When a variable is compared to itself, it is typically an indication
of a mistake since the Boolean value of the comparison will always
be the same.

## Solution
Remove the comparison and any associated dead code.

Example:

    # Correct:
    do_something()
    
    # Wrong:
    if a < a:
        do_something()
    else:
        do_something_else()
