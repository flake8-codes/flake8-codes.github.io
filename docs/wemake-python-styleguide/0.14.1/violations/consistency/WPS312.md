title: Found compare between same variable
---

Forbids to have compares between the same variable.

## Reasoning
When the same variables are compared it is typically an indication
of a mistake, since the Boolean value of the compare will always be
the same.

## Solution
Remove the same variable compare and any associated dead code.

## Example

    # Correct:
    do_something()
    
    # Wrong:
    if a < a:
        do_something()
    else:
        do_something_else()
