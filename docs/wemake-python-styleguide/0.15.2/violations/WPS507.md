Forbid unpythonic zero-length compare.

Note, that we allow to check arbitrary length, like ``len(arr) == 3``.

Reasoning:
    Python's structures like dicts, lists, sets, and tuples
    all have ``__bool__`` method to checks their length.
    So, there's no point in wrapping them into ``len(...)``
    and checking that it is bigger that ``0`` or less then ``1``, etc.

Solution:
    Remove extra ``len()`` call.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if some_array or not other_array or len(third_array) == 1:
        ...

    # Wrong:
    if len(some_array) > 0 or len(other_array) < 1:
        ...
