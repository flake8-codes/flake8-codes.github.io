Forbid `__future__` imports.

## Reasoning
Almost all `__future__` imports are legacy `python2` compatibility
tools that are no longer required.

## Solution
Remove them. Drop `python2` support.

Except, there are some new ones for `python4` support. See
{{ wps.constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.FUTURE_IMPORTS_WHITELIST') }} for
the full list of allowed future imports.

## Example

    # Correct:
    from __future__ import annotations
    
    # Wrong:
    from __future__ import print_function
