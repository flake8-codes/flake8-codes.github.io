title: 'Found noqa comments overuse: _'

Forbids to use too many `# noqa` comments.

We count it on a per-module basis.

## Reasoning
Having too many `# noqa` comments make your code less readable and
clearly indicates that there's something wrong with it.

## Solution
Refactor your code to match our style. Or use a config file to
switch off some checks.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-noqa-comments`. Default:
`MAX_NOQA_COMMENTS`
