Forbid meaningless zeros.

We discourage using meaningless zeros in float, binary, octal, hex, and
exponential numbers.

  - Reasoning:  
    There are \~infinite ways to write these numbers by adding
    meaningless leading zeros to the number itself. `0b1` is the same as
    `0b01` and `0b001`. How can a language be called consistent if you
    can write numbers in an infinite ways? It hurts readability and
    understanding of your code.

  - Solution:  
    Remove meaningless leading zeros.

Example:

    # Correct:
    numbers = [1.5, 0b1, 0o2, 0x5, 10e10]
    
    # Wrong:
    numbers = [1.50, 0b00000001, 0o0002, 0x05, 10e010]
