title: Found `else` in a loop without `break`
---

Forbid `else` without `break` in a loop.

We use the same logic for `for` and `while` loops.

  - Reasoning:  
    When there's no `break` keyword in loop's body it means that `else`
    will always be called. This rule will reduce complexity, improve
    readability, and protect from possible errors.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your `else` case logic to be inside the loop's body. Or
    right after it.

Example:

    # Correct:
    for letter in 'abc':
        if letter == 'b':
            break
    else:
        print('"b" is not found')
    
    for letter in 'abc':
        print(letter)
    print('always called')
    
    # Wrong:
    for letter in 'abc':
        print(letter)
    else:
        print('always called')
