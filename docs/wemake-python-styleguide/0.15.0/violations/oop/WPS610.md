title: 'Found forbidden async magic method usage: _'
---

Forbid certain async magic methods.

We allow to make `__anext__`, `__aenter__`, `__aexit__` async. We also
allow custom magic methods to be async.

See
`ASYNC_MAGIC_METHODS_BLACKLIST`
for the whole list of blacklisted async magic methods.

## Reasoning
Defining the magic methods as async which are not supposed to be
async would not work as expected.

## Solution
Do not make this magic method async.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class Test(object):
        def __lt__(self, other): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        async def __lt__(self, other): ...
