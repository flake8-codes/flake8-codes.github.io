title: Found unnecessary literals
---


Forbid unnecessary literals in your code.

Reasoning:
    We discourage using primitive calls to get default type values.
    There are better ways to get these values.

Solution:
    Use direct default values of the given type

Example::

    # Correct:
    default = 0

    # Wrong:
    default = int()
