title: Found incorrect exception order
---


Forbid incorrect order of ``except``.

Note, we only check for built-in exceptions
because we cannot statically identify
the inheritance order of custom ones.

Reasoning:
    Using incorrect order of exceptions is error-prone, since
    you end up with some unreachable exception clauses.

Solution:
    Use the correct order of exceptions.

Example::

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    except ValueError:
        ...
    except Exception:
        ...

    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    except Exception:
        ...
    except ValueError:
        ...
