code: WPS415
internalName: DuplicateExceptionViolation
title: 'Found duplicate exception: _'
---

Forbids to have the same exception class in multiple `except` blocks.

## Reasoning
Having the same exception name in different blocks means that
something is not right: since only one branch will work. Other one
will always be ignored. So, that is clearly an error.

## Solution
Use unique exception handling rules.

## Example

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    except ValueError:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    except ValueError:
        ...
    except ValueError:
        ...
