Restrict unicode names.

## Reasoning
This should be forbidden for sanity, readability, and writability.

## Solution
Rename your entities so that they contain only ASCII symbols.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, methods,
and classes.

## Example

    # Correct:
    some_variable = 'Text with russian: русский язык'
    
    # Wrong:
    переменная = 42
    some_變量 = ''
