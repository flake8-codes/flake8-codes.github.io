title: Found f string

Forbids to use `f` strings.

## Reasoning
`f` strings looses context too often and they are hard to lint.
Imagine that you have a string that breaks when you move it two
lines above. That's not how a string should behave. Also, they
promote a bad practice: putting your logic inside the template.

## Solution
Use `.format()` with indexed params instead.

## Example

    # Wrong:
    f'Result is: {2 + 2}'
    
    # Correct:
    'Result is: {0}'.format(2 + 2)
    'Hey {user}! How are you?'.format(user='sobolevn')
