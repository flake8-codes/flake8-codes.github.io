title: Found `break` or `continue` in `finally` block
---

Forbid `break` and `continue` in a `finally` block.

Related to `~TryExceptMultipleReturnPathViolation`.

  - Reasoning:  
    Putting any control statements in
    <span class="title-ref">finally</span> is a terrible practice,
    because <span class="title-ref">finally</span> is implicitly called
    and can cause damage to your logic with its implicitness. It should
    not be allowed.

  - Solution:  
    Remove `break` and `continue` from `finally` blocks.

Example:

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        break
    
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        continue
