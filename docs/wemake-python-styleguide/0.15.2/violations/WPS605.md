Forbid methods without any arguments.

  - Reasoning:  
    Methods without arguments are allowed to be defined, but almost
    impossible to use. Furthermore, they don't have an access to `self`,
    so cannot access the inner state of the object. It might be an
    intentional design or just a typo.

  - Solution:  
    Move any methods with arguments to raw functions. Or just add an
    argument if it is actually required.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class Test(object):
        def method(self): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        def method(): ...
