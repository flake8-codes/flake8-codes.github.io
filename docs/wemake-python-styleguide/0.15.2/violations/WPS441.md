title: 'Found control variable used after block: {0}'

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid control variables after the block body.

What we call block control variables:

1.  `for` loop unpacked variables
2.  `with` context variables

<!-- end list -->

  - Reasoning:  
    Variables leaking from the blocks can damage your logic. It might
    not contain what you think they contain.

  - Solution:  
    Use names inside the scope they are defined. Create new functions to
    return values in case you need to use block variables: when
    searching for a value, etc.

Example:

    # Correct:
    for my_item in collection:
        print(my_item)
    
    # Wrong:
    for my_item in collection:
        ...
    print(my_item)
