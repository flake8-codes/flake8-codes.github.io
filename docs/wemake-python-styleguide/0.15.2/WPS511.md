Forbid multiple ``isinstance`` calls on the same variable.

Reasoning:
    The best practice is to use ``isinstance`` with tuple
    as the second argument, instead of multiple conditions
    joined with ``or``.

Solution:
    Use tuple of types as the second argument.

Example::

    # Correct:
    isinstance(some, (int, float))

    # Wrong:
    isinstance(some, int) or isinstance(some, float)
