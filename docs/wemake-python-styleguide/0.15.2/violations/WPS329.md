Forbid meaningless ``except`` cases.

Reasoning:
    Using ``except`` cases that just reraise the same exception
    is error-prone. You can increase your stacktrace,
    silence some potential exceptions, and screw things up.
    It also does not make any sense to do so.

Solution:
    Remove ``except`` case or make sure it makes sense.

Example::

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    except IndexError:
        sentry.log()
        raise ValueError()

    try:
        ...
    except ValueError as exc:
        raise CustomReadableException from exc

    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    except TypeError:
        raise
