Forbid long variable or module names.

  - Reasoning:  
    Too long names are unreadable. It is better to use a shorter
    alternative. Long names also indicate that this variable is too
    complex, maybe it may require some documentation.

  - Solution:  
    Think of another name. Give less context to it.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, methods,
and classes.

Example:

    # Correct:
    total_price = 25
    average_age = 45
    
    # Wrong:
    final_price_after_fifteen_percent_sales_tax_and_gratuity = 30
    total_age_of_all_participants_in_the_survey_divided_by_twelve = 2

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-name-length`. Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_NAME_LENGTH') }}
