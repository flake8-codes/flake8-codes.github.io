Forbid certain magic methods.

  - Reasoning:  
    We forbid to use magic methods related to the forbidden language
    parts. Likewise, we forbid to use `del` keyword, so we forbid to use
    all magic methods related to it.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your code to use custom methods instead. It will give more
    context to your app.

See :py`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAGIC_METHODS_BLACKLIST` for
the full blacklist of the magic methods.
