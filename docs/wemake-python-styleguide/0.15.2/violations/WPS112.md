Forbid private name pattern.

  - Reasoning:  
    Private is not private in `python`. So, why should we pretend it is?
    This might lead to some serious design flaws.

  - Solution:  
    Rename your variable or method to be protected. Think about your
    design, why do you want to make it private? Are there any other ways
    to achieve what you want?

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, and
methods.

Example:

    # Correct:
    def _collect_coverage(self): ...
    
    # Wrong:
    def __collect_coverage(self): ...
