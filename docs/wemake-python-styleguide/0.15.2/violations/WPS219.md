Forbid consecutive expressions with too deep access level.

We consider only these expressions as accesses:

- ``ast.Subscript``
- ``ast.Attribute``

We do not treat ``ast.Call`` as an access, since there are
a lot of call-based APIs like Django ORM, builder patterns, etc.

Reasoning:
    Having too deep access level indicates a bad design
    and overcomplicated data without proper API.

Solution:
    Split the expression into variables, functions or classes.
    Refactor the API for your data layout.

Example::

    # Correct: access level = 4
    self.attr.inner.wrapper[1]

    # Correct: access level = 1
    manager.filter().exclude().annotate().values().first()

    # Wrong: access level = 5
    self.attr.inner.wrapper.method.call()

    # Wrong: access level = 5
    # `obj` has access level of 2:
    # `.attr`, `.call`
    # `call()` has access level of 5:
    # `.other`, `[0]`, `.field`, `.type`, `.boom`
    obj.attr.call().other[0].field.type.boom

Configuration:
    This rule is configurable with ``--max-access-level``.
    Default:
    :str:`wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_ACCESS_LEVEL`
