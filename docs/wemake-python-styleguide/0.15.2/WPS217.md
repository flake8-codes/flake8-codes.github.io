title: 'Found too many await expressions: {0}'
---


Forbid placing too many ``await`` expressions in a function.

Reasoning:
    When there are too many ``await`` keywords,
    functions are starting to get really complex.
    It is hard to tell where we are and what is going on.

Solution:
    Change your design. Split functions into smaller ones.

Configuration:
    This rule is configurable with ``--max-awaits``.
    Default: :str:`wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_AWAITS`
