title: 'Found too many return statements: _'
---

Forbids placing too many `return` statements into the function.

## Reasoning
When there are too many `return` keywords, functions are hard to
test. They are also hard to read and hard to change and keep
everything inside your head at once.

## Solution
Change your design.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-returns`. Default:
`MAX_RETURNS`

<div class="versionadded">

0.1.0
