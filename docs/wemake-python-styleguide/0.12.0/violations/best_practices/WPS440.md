title: 'Found block variables overlap: _'

Forbids to local and block variables to overlap.

What we call local variables:

1.  Assigns and annotations
2.  Function arguments (they are local to the function body)

What we call block variables:

1.  Imports
2.  Functions and async functions definitions
3.  Classes, methods, and async methods definitions
4.  For and async for loops variables
5.  Except block exception aliases

We allow local variables to overlap theirselfs, we forbid block varibals
to overlap theirselfs.

## Reasoning
A lot of complex errors might happen when you shadow local varibales
with block variables or when you shadow block variables with local
variables.

## Solution
Use names that do not overlap.

## Example

    # Correct:
    my_value = 1
    my_value = my_value + 1
    
    # Wrong:
    import my_value
    my_value = 1  # overlaps with import
