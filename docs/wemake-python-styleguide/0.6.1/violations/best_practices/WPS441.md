Forbids to use protected attributes and methods.

## Reasoning
When using protected attributes and method we break a contract that
authors of this class enforce. This way we are not respecting
encapsulation and it may break our code at any moment.

## Solution
Do not use protected attributes and methods. Respect the
encapsulation.

## Example

    # Correct:
    self._protected = 1
    cls._hidden_method()
    some.public()
    
    # Wrong:
    print(some._protected)
    instance._hidden()
    self.container._internal = 10

Note, that it is possible to use protected attributes with `self` and
`cls` as base names. We allow this so you can create and use protected
attributes and methods inside the class context. This is how protected
attributes should be used.
