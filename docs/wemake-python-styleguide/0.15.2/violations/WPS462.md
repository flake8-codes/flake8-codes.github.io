title: Wrong multiline string usage

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}


Frobids direct usage of multiline strings.

Multiline strings are only allowed in docstrings
or assignments to variables.

Reasoning:
    Direct usage of multiline strings is not readable.
    One should not depend on the current indentation,
    e.g. in comparisons or function calls.

Solution:
    Assign a multiline string to a variable.

Example::

    # Correct:
    multiline = """
        abc
        abc
    """

    # Wrong:
    function("""
        abc
        abc
    """)
