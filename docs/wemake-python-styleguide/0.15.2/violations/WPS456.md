title: Found "NaN" as argument to float()

Forbids using `float("NaN")` construct to generate NaN.

  - Reasoning:  
    This method to generate NaN is really confusing and is a good way to
    catch a lot of unexpected bugs.

  - Solution:  
    Even if you're 100% sure what you're doing, use `math.nan` instead.

Example:

    # Correct:
    min(math.nan, 3)
    
    # Wrong:
    min(float("NAN"), 3)
