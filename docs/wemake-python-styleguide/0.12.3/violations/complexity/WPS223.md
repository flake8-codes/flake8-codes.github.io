title: 'Found too many elif branches: _'

Forbids to use many `elif` branches.

## Reasoning
This rule is specifically important because of many `elif` branches
indicate a complex flow in your design: you are reimplementing
`switch` in python.

## Solution
There are different design patterns to use instead. For example, you
can use some interface that just call a specific method without
`if`. Or separate your `if` into multiple functions.
