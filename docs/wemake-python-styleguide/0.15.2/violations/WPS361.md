title: Found an inconsistently structured comprehension
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids inconsistent newlines in comprehensions.

Reasoning: We do this for consistency.

Solution: Either place comprehension on a single line or ensure that
action, for loops, and condition are all on different lines.

Example::

    # Correct:
    list = [some(number) for number in numbers]
    
    list = [
       some(number)
       for numbers in matrix
       for number in numbers
       if number > 0
    ]
    
    # Wrong:
    list = [
        some(number) for number in numbers
        if number > 0
    ]
