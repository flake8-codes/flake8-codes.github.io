Forbids to use `\\` escape sequences inside regular strings.

## Reasoning
It is hard to read escape sequencse inside regular strings, because
they use `\\` double backslash for a single character escape.

## Solution
Use raw strings `r''` to rewrite the escape sequence with a `\`
single backslash.

## Example

    # Correct:
    escaped = [r'\n', '\n']
    
    # Wrong:
    escaped = '\\n'
