Restrict the maximum number of decorators.

Reasoning:
    When you are using too many decorators it means that
    you are trying to overuse the magic.
    You have to ask yourself: do I really know what happens inside
    this decorator tree? Typically, the answer will be "no".

Solution:
    Using too many decorators typically means that
    you are trying to configure the behavior from outside of the class.
    Do not do that too much.
    Split functions or classes into smaller ones.
    Use higher order decorators.

Configuration:
    This rule is configurable with ``--max-decorators``.
    Default:
    :str:`wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_DECORATORS`

This rule checks: functions, methods, and classes.
