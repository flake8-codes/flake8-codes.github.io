title: Found an infinite while loop

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids use of infinite `while True:` loops.

Reasoning: Infinite loops will cause bugs in code.

Solution: Add either a return, raise, or break to handle the infinite
loop.

Example::

    # Correct:
    while True:
        print('forever')
        break
    
    # Wrong:
    while True:
        print('forever')
