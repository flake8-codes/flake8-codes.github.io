Forbids to use extra indentation.

## Reasoning
You can use extra indentation for lines of code. Python allows you
to do that in case you will keep the indentation level equal for
this specific node. But, that's insane\!

## Solution
Place bracket on the same line, when a single line expression. Or
place bracket on a new line when a multi-line expression.

## Example

    # Correct:
    print([
        1, 2, 3,
    ])
    
    print(
        1,
        2,
    )
    
    def _annotate_brackets(
        tokens: List[tokenize.TokenInfo],
    ) -> TokenLines:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    print([
        1, 2, 3],
    )
    
    print(
        1,
        2)
    
    def _annotate_brackets(
        tokens: List[tokenize.TokenInfo]) -> TokenLines:
        ...

We check round, square, and curly brackets.
