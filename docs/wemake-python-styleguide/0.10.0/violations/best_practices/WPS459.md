title: Found complex default value

Forbids to use complex defaults.

Anything that is not a `ast.Name`, `ast.Attribute`, `ast.Str`,
`ast.NameConstant`, `ast.Tuple`, `ast.Bytes`, `ast.Num` or
`ast.Ellipsis` should be moved out from defaults.

## Reasoning
It can be tricky. Nothing stops you from making database calls or
http requests in such expressions. It is also not readable for us.

## Solution
Move the expression out from default value.

## Example

    # Correct:
    SHOULD_USE_DOCTEST = 'PYFLAKES_DOCTEST' in os.environ
    def __init__(self, with_doctest=SHOULD_USE_DOCTEST):
    
    # Wrong:
    def __init__(self, with_doctest='PYFLAKES_DOCTEST' in os.environ):
