{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids too many `raise` statements in a function.

Reasoning: Too many `raise` statements in a function make the code
untraceable and overcomplicated.

Solution: Split the function into smaller functions, such that each of
them can raise less errors. Create more standard errors, or use
alternative ways to raise them.

Configuration: This rule is configurable with `--max-raises`. Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_RAISES') }}
