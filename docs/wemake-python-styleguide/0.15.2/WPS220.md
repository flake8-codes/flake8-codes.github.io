title: 'Found too deep nesting: {0}'

Forbid nesting blocks too deep.

Reasoning:
    If nesting is too deep that indicates usage of complex logic
    and language constructions. This means that our design is not
    suited to handle such construction.

Solution:
    We need to refactor our complex construction into simpler ones.
    We can use new functions or different constructions.
