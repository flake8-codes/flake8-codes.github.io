Forbid implicit ``sum()`` calls.

When summing types different from numbers, you might need to provide
the second argument to the ``sum`` function: ``sum([[1], [2], [3]], [])``

You might also use ``str.join`` to join iterable of strings.

Reasoning:
    Using ``for`` loops with ``+=`` assign inside indicates
    that you iteratively sum things inside your collection.
    That's what ``sum()`` builtin function does.

Solution:
    Use ``sum(...)`` instead of a loop with ``+=`` operation.

Example::

    # Correct:
    sum_result = sum(get_elements())

    # Wrong:
    sum_result = 0
    for to_sum in get_elements():
        sum_result += to_sum
