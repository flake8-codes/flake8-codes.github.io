title: Found incorrect yield from target
---

Forbids to use `yield from` with several nodes.

We allow to `yield from` tuples, names, attributes, calls, and
subscripts.

## Reasoning
We enforce consitency when yielding values from tuple instead of any
other types. It also might be an error when you try to `yield from`
something that is not iterable.

## Solution
Use allowed node types with `yield from`.

## Example

    # Correct:
    yield from (1, 2, 3)
    yield from some
    
    # Wrong:
    yield from [1, 2, 3]
