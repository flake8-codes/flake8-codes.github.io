These checks ensure that you follow the best practices.

The source for these best practices is hidden inside countless hours we
have spent debugging software or reviewing it.

How do we find inspiration for new rules? We find some ugly code during
code reviews and audits. Then we forbid to use this bad code forever.
So, this error will never return to our codebase.
