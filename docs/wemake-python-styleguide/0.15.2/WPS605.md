title: 'Found method without arguments: {0}'

Forbid methods without any arguments.

Reasoning:
    Methods without arguments are allowed to be defined,
    but almost impossible to use.
    Furthermore, they don't have an access to ``self``,
    so cannot access the inner state of the object.
    It might be an intentional design or just a typo.

Solution:
    Move any methods with arguments to raw functions.
    Or just add an argument if it is actually required.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Test(object):
        def method(self): ...

    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        def method(): ...
