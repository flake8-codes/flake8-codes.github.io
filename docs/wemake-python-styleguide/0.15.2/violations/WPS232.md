{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid modules with average cognitive complexity that is too high.

Reasoning: Modules with lots of functions might hide cognitive
complexity inside many small and relatively simple functions.

Solution: Rewrite your code to be simpler or use several modules.

Configuration: This rule is configurable with `--max-cognitive-average`.
Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_COGNITIVE_AVERAGE') }}
