Forbid implicit string concatenation.

Reasoning: This is error-prone, since you can possibly miss a comma in a
collection of strings and get an implicit concatenation. And because
there are safer ways to do the same thing it is better to use them
instead.

Solution: Use `+` or `.format()` to join strings.

Example::

    # Correct:
    text = 'first' + 'second'
    
    # Wrong:
    text = 'first' 'second'
