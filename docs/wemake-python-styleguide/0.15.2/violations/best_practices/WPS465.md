title: Found likely bitwise and boolean operation mixup
---

Forbid comparisons between bitwise and boolean expressions.

Empty comments are only allowed in between valid comments.

  - Reasoning:  
    This case indicates that a person confused `&` with `and` and `|`
    with `or`. This can be the case if a person is coming from another
    language.

  - Solution:  
    Change bitwise operator to boolean operators.

Example:

    # Correct:
    first | 10
    
    # Wrong:
    result = ((first > 0) & False)
