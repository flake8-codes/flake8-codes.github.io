title: Found exception inherited from BaseException
---

Forbid exceptions inherited from `BaseException`.

  - Reasoning:  
    `BaseException` is a special case: it is not designed to be extended
    by users. A lot of your `except Exception` cases won't work. That's
    incorrect and dangerous.

  - Solution:  
    Change the base class to `Exception`.

Example:

    # Correct:
    class MyException(Exception):
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    class MyException(BaseException):
        ...
