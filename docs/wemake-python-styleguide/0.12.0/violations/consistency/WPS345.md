title: Found meaningless number operation
---

Forbids to use meaningless math opeartions with `0` and `1`.

## Reasoning
Adding and substracting zero does not change the value. There's no
need to do that. Multipling by zero is also redundunt: it can be
replaced with explicit `0` assign. Multiplying and dividing by `1`
is also meaningless.

## Solution
Remove useless zero operaionts.

## Example

    # Correct:
    number = 1
    zero = 0
    one = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    number = 1 + 0 * 1
    zero = some * 0 / 1
    one = some ** 0 ** 1
