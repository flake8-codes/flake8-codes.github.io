Forbid assigning a variable to itself.

## Reasoning
There is no need to do that. Generally, it is an indication of some
errors or just dead code.

## Example

    # Correct:
    some = some + 1
    x_coord, y_coord = y_coord, x_coord
    
    # Wrong:
    some = some
    x_coord, y_coord = x_coord, y_coord
