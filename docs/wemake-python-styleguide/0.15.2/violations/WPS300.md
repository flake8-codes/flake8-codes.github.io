{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid imports relative to the current folder.

Reasoning: We should pick one style and stick to it. We have decided to
use the explicit one.

Solution: Refactor your imports to use the absolute path.

Example::

    # Correct:
    from my_package.version import get_version
    
    # Wrong:
    from .version import get_version
    from ..drivers import MySQLDriver

.. versionadded:: 0.1.0
