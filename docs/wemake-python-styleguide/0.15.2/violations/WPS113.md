{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid using the same alias as the original name in imports.

Reasoning: Why would you even do this in the first place?

Example::

    # Correct:
    from os import path
    
    # Wrong:
    from os import path as path

When `--i-control-code` is set to `False` you can reexport things with
`as`, because `mypy` might require it with `implicit_reexport = False`
setting turned on.

Configuration: This rule is configurable with `--i-control-code` and
`--i-dont-control-code`. Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.I_CONTROL_CODE') }}
