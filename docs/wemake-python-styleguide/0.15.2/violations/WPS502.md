title: Found simplifiable `if` condition
---

Forbid simplifiable `if` conditions.

  - Reasoning:  
    These complex constructions can cause frustration among other
    developers. They are longer, more verbose, and more complex.

  - Solution:  
    Either use `bool()` to convert test values to boolean values, or
    just leave it as it is in case your test already returns a boolean
    value. Use can also use `not` keyword to switch boolean values.

Example:

    # Correct:
    my_bool = bool(some_call())
    other_value = 8 if some_call() else None
    
    # Wrong:
    my_bool = True if some_call() else False

We only check `if` nodes where `True` and `False` values are used. We
check both `if` nodes and `if` expressions.
