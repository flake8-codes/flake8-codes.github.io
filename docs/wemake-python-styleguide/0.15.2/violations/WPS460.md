title: Found single element destructuring
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids to have single element destructuring.

  - Reasoning:  
    Having single element destructuring is not readable.

  - Solution:  
    Use access by index instead.

Example:

    # Correct:
    first = single_element_list[0]
    
    # Wrong:
    (first,) = [1]
