title: 'Found too many raises in a function: _'
---

Forbids too many `raise` statements in a function.

## Reasoning
Too many `raise` statements in a function make the code untraceable
and overcomplicated.

## Solution
Split the function into smaller functions, such that each of them
can raise less errors. Create more standard errors, or use
alternative ways to raise them.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-raises`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_RAISES') }}
