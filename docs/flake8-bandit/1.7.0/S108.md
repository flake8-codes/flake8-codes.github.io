title: Test for insecure usage of tmp file/directory
---

Safely creating a temporary file or directory means following a number
of rules (see the references for more details). This plugin test looks
for strings starting with (configurable) commonly used temporary paths,
for example:

>   - /tmp
>   - /var/tmp
>   - /dev/shm
>   - etc

**Config Options:**

This test plugin takes a similarly named config block,
<span class="title-ref">hardcoded\_tmp\_directory</span>. The config
block provides a Python list, <span class="title-ref">tmp\_dirs</span>,
that lists string fragments indicating possible temporary file paths.
Any string starting with one of these fragments will report a MEDIUM
confidence issue.

```yaml
hardcoded_tmp_directory:
    tmp_dirs: ['/tmp', '/var/tmp', '/dev/shm']
```
