title: 'Found too deep nesting: _'
---

Forbids nesting blocks too deep.

## Reasoning
If nesting is too deep that indicates usage of a complex logic and
language constructions. This means that our design is not suited to
handle such construction.

## Solution
We need to refactor our complex construction into simpler ones. We
can use new functions or different constructions.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-offset-blocks`. Default:
`MAX_OFFSET_BLOCKS`
