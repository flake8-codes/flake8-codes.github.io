Forbid letters as hex numbers.

Reasoning:
    One can write ``0xA`` and ``0xa`` which is inconsistent.
    This rule enforces upper-case letters in hex numbers.

Solution:
    Use uppercase letters in hex numbers.

Example::

    # Correct:
    number = 0xABCDEF

    # Wrong:
    number = 0xabcdef
