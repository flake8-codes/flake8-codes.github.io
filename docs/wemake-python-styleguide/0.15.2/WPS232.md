title: 'Found module cognitive complexity that is too high: {0}'
---


Forbid modules with average cognitive complexity that is too high.

Reasoning:
    Modules with lots of functions might hide cognitive complexity
    inside many small and relatively simple functions.

Solution:
    Rewrite your code to be simpler
    or use several modules.

Configuration:
    This rule is configurable with ``--max-cognitive-average``.
    Default:
    :str:`wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_COGNITIVE_AVERAGE`
