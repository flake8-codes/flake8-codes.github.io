code: WPS313
internalName: MissingSpaceBetweenKeywordAndParenViolation
title: Found parens right after a keyword
---

Forbid opening parenthesis from following keyword without space in
between.

## Reasoning
Some people use `return` and `yield` keywords as functions. The same
happened to good old `print` in Python2.

## Solution
Insert space symbol between keyword and open paren.

## Example

    # Wrong:
    def func():
        a = 1
        b = 2
        del(a, b)
        yield(1, 2, 3)
    
    # Correct:
    def func():
        a = 1
        del (a, b)
        yield (1, 2, 3)

<div class="versionadded">
