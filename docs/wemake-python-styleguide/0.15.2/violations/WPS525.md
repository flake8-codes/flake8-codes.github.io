title: Found wrong `in` compare with single item container
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid comparisons where `in` is compared with single item container.

  - Reasoning:  
    `in` comparison with a container which contains only one item looks
    like overhead and unneeded complexity.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your code to use `==` instead `in`.

Example:

    # Correct:
    a == 's'
    
    # Wrong:
    a in {'s'}
