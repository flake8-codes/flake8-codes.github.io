Forbid duplicate items in hashes.

  - Reasoning:  
    When you explicitly put duplicate items in `set` literals or in
    `dict` keys it just does not make any sense since hashes cannot
    contain duplicate items and they will be removed anyway.

  - Solution:  
    Remove duplicate items.

Example:

    # Correct:
    some_set = {'a', variable1}
    some_set = {make_call(), make_call()}
    
    # Wrong:
    some_set = {'a', 'a', variable1, variable1}

Things that we consider duplicates: builtins and variables. These nodes
are not checked because they may return different results:

  - function and method calls
  - comprehensions
  - attributes
  - subscribe operations
