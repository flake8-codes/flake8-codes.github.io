title: 'Found too long try body length: _'
---

Forbid `try` blocks with bodies that are too long.

  - Reasoning:  
    Having too many statements inside your `try` block can lead to
    situations when a statement raises an exception and you are not
    aware of it since it is not expected.

  - Solution:  
    Move things out of the `try` block or create new functions. The
    fewer lines you have in your `try` block - the safer you are from
    accidental errors.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-try-body-length`. Default:
    {{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_TRY_BODY_LENGTH') }}
