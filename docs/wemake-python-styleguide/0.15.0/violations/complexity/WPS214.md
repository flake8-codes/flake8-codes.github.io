Forbid too many methods in a single class.

## Reasoning
Having too many methods might lead to the "God object" anti-pattern.
This kind of object can handle everything. So, in the end, your code
becomes too hard to maintain and test.

## Solution
What to do if you have too many methods in a single class? Split
this class into several classes, then use composition or inheritance
to refactor your code. This will protect you from the "God object"
anti-pattern.

We do not make any distinctions between instance and class methods. We
also do not care about functions and classes being public or not. We
also do not count inherited methods from parents. This rule does not
count the attributes of a class.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-methods`. Default:
`MAX_METHODS`
