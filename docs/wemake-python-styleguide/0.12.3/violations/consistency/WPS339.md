Forbids to use meaningless zeros.

We discorauge using meaningless zeros in float, binary, octal, hex, and
expanentional numbers.

## Reasoning
There are \~infinitive ways to write these numbers by adding
meaningless leading zeros to the number itself. `0b1` is the same as
`0b01` and `0b001`. How a language can be called consistent if you
can write numbers in a infinite ways? It hurts readability and
understanding of your code.

## Solution
Remove meaningless leading zeros.

## Example

    # Correct:
    numbers = [1.5, 0b1, 0o2, 0x5, 10e10]
    
    # Wrong:
    numbers = [1.50, 0b00000001, 0o0002, 0x05, 10e010]
