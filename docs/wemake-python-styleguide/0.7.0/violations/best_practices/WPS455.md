title: Found incorrect __slots__ syntax
---

Forbids to have incorrect `__slots__` definition.

## Reasoning
`__slots__` is a very special attribute. It completely changes your
class. So, we need to be careful with it. We should not allow
anything rather than tuples to define slots, we also need to check
that fields defined in `__slots__` are unique.

## Solution
Use tuples with unique elements to define `__slots__` attribute.

## Example

    # Correct:
    class Test(object):
        __slots__ = ('field1', 'field2')
    
    class Other(Test):
        __slots__ = Test.__slots__ + ('child',)
    
    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        __slots__ = ['field1', 'field2', 'field2']

Note, that we do ignore all complex expressions for this field. So, we
only check raw literals.
