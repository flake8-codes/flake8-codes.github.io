title: Found missing empty line between coding magic comment and code
---

Enforces to have an extra empty line after the `coding` comment.

## Reasoning
Since we use ``flake8-coding
<https://github.com/tk0miya/flake8-coding>`_ as a part of our linter
we care about extra space after this coding comment. This is done
for pure consistency. Why should we even care about this magic
coding comment? For several reasons. First, explicit encoding is
always better that an implicit one, different countries still use
some non utf-8 encodings as a default. But, people might override it
with other encodings in a comment. Do you know how much pain it can
cause to you? We still know that``python3`uses`utf-8`inside. Second,
some tools break because of this incorrect encoding comment.
Including,`django`,`flake8`, and`tokenize\`\` core module. It is
very hard to notice these things when they happen.

## Solution
Add an empty line between `coding` magic comment and your code.

## Example

    # Correct:
    # coding: utf-8
    
    SOME_VAR = 1
    
    # Wrong:
    # coding: utf-8
    SOME_VAR = 1
