Forbid imports that may cause confusion outside of the module.

Names that we forbid to import:

  - Common names like `dumps` and `loads`
  - Names starting with `to_` and `from_`
  - Too short names like `Q` or `F`, but we are fine with `_`

Reasoning: See `datetime.*` in code? You know that it's from datetime.
See `BaseView` in a Django project? You know where it is from. See
`loads`? It can be anything: `yaml`, `toml`, `json`, etc. We are also
enforcing consistency with our naming too-short rules here.

Solution: Use package level imports or import aliases.

See
:py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.VAGUE_IMPORTS_BLACKLIST`
for the full list of bad import names.

Example::

    # Correct:
    import json
    import dumps  # package names are not checked
    from json import loads as json_loads
    
    # Wrong:
    from json import loads
