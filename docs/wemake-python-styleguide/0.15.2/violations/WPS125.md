Forbid variable or module names which shadow builtin names.

Reasoning: Your code simply breaks Python. After you create `list = 1`,
you cannot not call `builtin` function `list` and what can be worse than
that?

Solution: Rename your entity to not shadow Python builtins.

Example::

    # Correct:
    my_list = list(some_other)
    
    # Wrong:
    str = ''
    list = [1, 2, 3]

This can also cause problems when defining class attributes, for
example::

    class A:
        min = 5
        max = min(10, 20)  # TypeError: 'int' object is not callable

If you feel it is still necessary to use such a class attribute,
consider using a `noqa` comment with caution.

See :py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.BUILTINS_WHITELIST`
for full list of builtins we allow to shadow.
