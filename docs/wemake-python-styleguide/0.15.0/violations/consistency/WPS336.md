title: Found explicit string concatanation

Forbid explicit string concatanation in favour of `.format` method.

However, we still allow multiline string concatanation as a way to write
long strings that does not fit the 80-chars rule.

## Reasoning
When formatting strings one must use `.format` and not any other
formatting methods like `%`, `+`, or `f`. This is done for
consistency reasons.

## Solution
Join strings together if you can, or use `.format` method.

## Example

    # Correct:
    x = 'ab: {0}'.format(some_data)
    
    # Wrong:
    x = 'a' + 'b: ' + some_data
