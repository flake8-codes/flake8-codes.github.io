title: Found useless lambda declaration

Forbid useless proxy `lambda` expressions.

## Reasoning
Sometimes developers tend to overuse `lambda` expressions and they
wrap code that can be passed as is, without extra wrapping. The code
without extra `lambda` is easier to read and is more performant.

## Solution
Remove wrapping `lambda` declaration, use just the internal
function.

## Example

    # Correct:
    numbers = map(int, ['1', '2'])
    
    # Wrong:
    numbers = map(lambda string: int(string), ['1', '2'])
