code: WPS401
internalName: WrongDocCommentViolation
title: Found wrong doc comment
---

Forbids to use empty doc comments (`#:`).

## Reasoning
Doc comments are used to provide a documentation. But supplying
empty doc comments breaks this use-case. It is unclear why they can
be used with no contents.

## Solution
Add some documentation to this comment. Or remove it.

Empty doc comments are not caught by the default `pycodestyle` checks.

## Example

    # Correct:
    #: List of allowed names:
    NAMES_WHITELIST = ['feature', 'bug', 'research']
    
    # Wrong:
    #:
    NAMES_WHITELIST = ['feature', 'bug', 'research']
