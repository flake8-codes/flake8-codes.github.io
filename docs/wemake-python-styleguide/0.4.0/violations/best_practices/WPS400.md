code: WPS400
internalName: WrongMagicCommentViolation
title: 'Found wrong magic comment: _'
---

Restricts to use several control (or magic) comments.

We do not allow to use:

1.  `# noqa` comment without specified violations
2.  `# type: some_type` comments to specify a type for `typed_ast`

<!-- end list -->

## Reasoning
We cover several different use-cases in a single rule. `# noqa`
comment is restricted because it can hide other violations. `# type:
some_type` comment is restricted because we can already use type
annotations instead.

## Solution
Use `# noqa` comments with specified error types. Use type
annotations to specify types.

We still allow to use `# type: ignore` comment. Since sometimes it is
totally required.

## Example

    # Correct:
    type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa: A001
    coordinate: int = 10
    some.int_field = 'text'  # type: ignore
    
    # Wrong:
    type = MyClass.get_type()  # noqa
    coordinate = 10  # type: int
