title: 'Found call chain that is too long: _'
---

Forbid call chains that are too long.

## Reasoning
Call chains that are too long are overcomplicated and indicators of
bad API design.

## Solution
Split the expression into variables, functions or classes. Refactor
the API to allow higher-level access to functions.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-call-level`. Default:
`MAX_CALL_LEVEL`
