title: Found implicit string concatenation
---

Forbids to use implicit string contacatenation.

## Reasoning
This is error-prone, since you can possible miss a comma in a
collection of string and get an implicit concatenation. And because
there are different and safe ways to do the same thing it is better
to use them instead.

## Solution
Use `+` or `.format()` to join strings.

## Example

    # Correct:
    text = 'first' + 'second'
    
    # Wrong:
    text = 'first' 'second'
