title: Found reversed complex comparison

Forbid reversed order complex comparison expressions.

  - Reasoning:  
    Comparisons where comparators start from the lowest element are
    easier to read than one that start from the biggest one. It is also
    possible to write the same expression in two separate way, which is
    inconsistent.

  - Solution:  
    Reverse the order, so the smallest element comes first and the
    biggest one comes last.

Example:

    # Correct:
    if three < two < one:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if one > two > three:
        ...
