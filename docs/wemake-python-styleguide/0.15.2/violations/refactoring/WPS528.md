title: Found implicit .items() usage
---

Forbid implicit `.items()` iterator.

## Reasoning
When iterating over collection it is easy to forget to use
`.items()` when you need to access both keys and values. So, when
you access the iterable with the key inside a `for` loop, that's a
sign to refactor your code.

## Solution
Use `.items()` with direct keys and values when you need them.

Example:

    # Correct:
    for some_key, some_value in collection.items():
        print(some_key, some_value)
    
    # Wrong:
    for some_key in collection:
        print(some_key, collection[some_key])
