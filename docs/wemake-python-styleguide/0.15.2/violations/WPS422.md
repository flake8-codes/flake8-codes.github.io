Forbid `__future__` imports.

Reasoning: Almost all `__future__` imports are legacy `python2`
compatibility tools that are no longer required.

Solution: Remove them. Drop `python2` support.

Except, there are some new ones for `python4` support. See
:py:data:`~wemake_python_styleguide.constants.FUTURE_IMPORTS_WHITELIST`
for the full list of allowed future imports.

Example::

    # Correct:
    from __future__ import annotations
    
    # Wrong:
    from __future__ import print_function
