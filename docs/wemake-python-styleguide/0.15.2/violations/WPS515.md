title: Found `open()` used without a context manager
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `open()` without a context manager.

  - Reasoning:  
    When you `open()` something, you need to close it. When using a
    context manager - it is automatically done for you. When not using
    it - you might find yourself in a situation when file is not closed
    and is not accessible anymore.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor `open()` call to use `with`.

Example:

    # Correct:
    with open(filename) as file_obj:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    file_obj = open(filename)
