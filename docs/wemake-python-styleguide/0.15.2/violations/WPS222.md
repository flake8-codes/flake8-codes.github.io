{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid conditions with too many logical operators.

We use {{ macros.wps_constant('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAX_CONDITIONS') }} as a default
value.

  - Reasoning:  
    When reading through the complex conditions you will fail to
    understand all the possible branches. And you will end up putting
    debug breakpoint on this line just to figure out how it works.

  - Solution:  
    We can reduce the complexity of a single `if` by doing two things:
    creating new variables or creating nested `if` statements. Both of
    these actions will trigger other complexity checks.

We count `and` and `or` keywords as conditions.
