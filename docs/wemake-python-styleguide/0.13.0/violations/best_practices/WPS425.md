Forbids to pass booleans as non-keyword parameters.

## Reasoning
Passing boolean as regular positional parameters is very
non-descriptive. It is almost impossible to tell, what does this
parameter means. And you almost always have to look up the
implementation to tell what is going on.

## Solution
Pass booleans as keywords only. This will help you to save extra
context on what's going on.

## Example

    # Correct:
    UsersRepository.update(cache=True)
    
    # Wrong:
    UsersRepository.update(True)
