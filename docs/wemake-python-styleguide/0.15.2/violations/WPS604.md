title: Found incorrect node inside `class` body
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid incorrect nodes inside `class` definitions.

  - Reasoning:  
    Python allows us to have conditions, context managers, and even
    infinite loops inside `class` definitions. On the other hand, only
    methods, attributes, and docstrings make sense. So, we discourage
    using anything except these nodes in class bodies.

  - Solution:  
    If you have complex logic inside your class definition, most likely
    that you do something wrong. There are different options to refactor
    this mess. You can try metaclasses, decorators, builders, and other
    patterns.

Example:

    # Wrong:
    class Test(object):
        for _ in range(10):
            print('What?!')

We also allow some nested classes, check out `NestedClassViolation` for
