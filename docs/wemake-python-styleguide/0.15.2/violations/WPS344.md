title: Found explicit zero division

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid explicit division (or modulo) by zero.

Reasoning: This will just throw `ZeroDivisionError`. If that's what you
need: just throw it. No need to use undefined math behaviours. Or it
might be just a typo / mistake, then fix it.

Solution: Use `ZeroDivisionError` or make your number something besides
`0`.

Example::

    # Correct:
    raise ZeroDivisionError()
    
    # Wrong:
    1 / 0
    1 % 0
