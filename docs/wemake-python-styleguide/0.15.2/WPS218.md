title: 'Found too many `assert` statements: {0}'
---

Forbid placing too many `assert` statements into a function.

  - Reasoning:  
    When there are too many `assert` keywords, functions are starting to
    get really complex. It might indicate that your tests or contracts
    are too big.

  - Solution:  
    Create rich `assert` statements, use higher-level contracts, or
    create special guard functions.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-asserts`. Default:
    `wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_ASSERTS`
