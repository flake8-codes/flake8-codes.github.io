internalName: SameElementsInConditionViolation
title: Found duplicate logical condition
---

Forbids to use the same logical conditions in one expression.

## Reasoning
Using the same name in logical condition more that once indicates
that you are either making a logical mistake, or just
over-complicating your design.

## Solution
Remove the duplicating condition.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if some_value or other_value:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if some_value or some_value:
        ...
