code: 403
title: 'Found `noqa` comments overuse: {0}'

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid too many `` `# pragma: no cover `` comments.

We count them on a per-module basis. We use
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAX_NO_COVER_COMMENTS') }} as a
default value.

  - Reasoning:  
    Having too many `` `# pragma: no cover `` comments indicates that
    there's something wrong with the code. Moreover, it makes your tests
    useless, since they do not cover a big portion of your code.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your code to match the style. Or use a config file to
    switch off some checks.
