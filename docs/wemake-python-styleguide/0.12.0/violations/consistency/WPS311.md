internalName: MultipleInCompareViolation
title: Found multiple in compares
---

Forbids comparision where multiple `in` checks.

## Reasoning
Using multiple `in` is unreadable.

## Solution
Refactor your compare expression to use several `and` conditions or
separate `if` statements in case it is appropriate.

## Example

    # Correct:
    if item in bucket and bucket in master_list_of_buckets:
    if x_coord not in line and line not in square:
    
    # Wrong:
    if item in bucket in master_list_of_buckets:
    if x_cord not in line not in square:
