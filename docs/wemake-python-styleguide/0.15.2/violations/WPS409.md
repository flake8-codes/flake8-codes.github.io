title: Found heterogeneous compare
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid heterogeneous operators in one comparison.

Note, that we do allow mixing `` `> `` with `` `>= `` and `` `< `` with
`` `<= `` operators.

  - Reasoning:  
    This is hard to read and understand.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor the expression to have separate parts joined with
    `` `and `` boolean operator.

Example:

    # Correct:
    if x == y == z:
        ...
    
    if x > y >= z:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if x > y == 5:
        ...
    
    if x == y != z:
        ...
