{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid unnecessary literals in your code.

  - Reasoning:  
    We discourage using primitive calls to get default type values.
    There are better ways to get these values.

  - Solution:  
    Use direct default values of the given type

Example:

    # Correct:
    default = 0
    
    # Wrong:
    default = int()

<div class="versionadded">

0.13.0

</div>
