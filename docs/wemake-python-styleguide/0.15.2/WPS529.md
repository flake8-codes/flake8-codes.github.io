title: Found implicit `.get()` dict usage
---


Forbid implicit ``.get()`` dict method.

Reasoning:
    When using ``in`` with a dict key it is hard to keep the code clean.
    It is more convenient to use ``.get()`` and check for ``None`` later.

Solution:
    Use ``.get()`` with the key you need.
    Check for ``None`` in case you need it,
    or just act with the default value of the same type.

Example::

    # Correct:
    value = collection.get(key)
    if value is not None:
        print(value)

    # Wrong:
    if key in collection:
        print(collection[key])
