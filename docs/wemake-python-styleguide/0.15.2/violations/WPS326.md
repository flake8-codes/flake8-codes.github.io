title: Found implicit string concatenation
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid implicit string concatenation.

  - Reasoning:  
    This is error-prone, since you can possibly miss a comma in a
    collection of strings and get an implicit concatenation. And because
    there are safer ways to do the same thing it is better to use them
    instead.

  - Solution:  
    Use `+` or `.format()` to join strings.

Example:

    # Correct:
    text = 'first' + 'second'
    
    # Wrong:
    text = 'first' 'second'
