title: Found except BaseException

Forbid `BaseException` exception.

## Reasoning
We can silence system exit and keyboard interrupt with this
exception handler. It is almost the same as raw `except:` block.

## Solution
Handle `Exception`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, `GeneratorExit`, and
`SystemExit` separately. Do not use the plain `except:` keyword.

Example:

    # Correct:
    except Exception as ex: ...
    
    # Wrong:
    except BaseException as ex: ...

<div class="versionadded">
