title: Found negated condition

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid negated conditions together with `else` clause.

Reasoning: It easier to read and name regular conditions. Not negated
ones.

Solution: Move actions from the negated `if` condition to the `else`
condition.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if some == 1:
         ...
    else:
         ...
    
    if not some:
         ...
    
    if not some:
        ...
    elif other:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if not some:
         ...
    else:
         ...
