title: Found `in` used with a non-set container
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `in` with static containers except `set` nodes.

We enforce people to use sets as a static containers. You can also use
variables, calls, methods, etc. Dynamic values are not checked.

Reasoning: Using static `list`, `tuple`, or `dict` elements to check
that some element is inside the container is a bad practice. Because we
need to iterate all over the container to find the element. Sets are the
best suit for this task. Moreover, it makes your code consistent.

Solution: Use `set` elements or comprehensions to check that something
is contained in a container.

Example::

    # Correct:
    print(needle in {'one', 'two'})
    
    # Wrong:
    print(needle in ['one', 'two'])
