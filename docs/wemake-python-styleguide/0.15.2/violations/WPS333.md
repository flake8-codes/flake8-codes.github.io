Forbid implicit complex comparison expressions.

  - Reasoning:  
    Two comparisons in python that are joined with `and` operator mean
    that you have a complex comparison with tree operators.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your comparison without `and` but with the third operator.
    Notice that you might have to change the ordering.

Example:

    # Correct:
    if three < two < one:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if one > two and two > three:
        ...
