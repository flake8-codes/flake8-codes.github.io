title: Found incorrect `not` with compare usage
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `not` with compare expressions.

  - Reasoning:  
    This version of `not` operator is unreadable.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor the expression without `not` operator. Change the compare
    signs.

Example:

    # Correct:
    if x <= 5:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if not x > 5:
        ...
