title: 'Found too long try body length: _'
---

Forbids to have `try` blocks with too long bodies.

## Reasoning
Having too many statements inside your `try` block can lead to
situations when some different statement raises an exception and you
are not aware of it since it is not expected.

## Solution
Move things out of the `try` block or create new functions. The less
lines you have in your `try` block - the safer you are from
accidental errors.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-try-body-length`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_TRY_BODY_LENGTH') }}
