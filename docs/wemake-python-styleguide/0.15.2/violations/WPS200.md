Forbid modules with complex lines.

We are using the Jones Complexity algorithm to count module's score. See
:class:`~.LineComplexityViolation` for details of
per-line-complexity. How it is done: we count complexity per line, then
measure the median complexity across the lines in the whole module.

Reasoning: Having complex modules will decrease your code
maintainability.

Solution: Refactor the module contents.

Configuration: This rule is configurable with `--max-jones-score`.
Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_JONES_SCORE') }}

.. versionadded:: 0.1.0
