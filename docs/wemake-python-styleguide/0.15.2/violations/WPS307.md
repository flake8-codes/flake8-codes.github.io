title: Found list comprehension with multiple `if`s
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid multiple `if` statements inside list comprehensions.

  - Reasoning:  
    It is very hard to read multiple `if` statements inside a list
    comprehension. Since it is even hard to tell all of them should pass
    or fail.

  - Solution:  
    Use a single `if` statement inside list comprehensions. Use
    `filter()` if you have complicated logic.

Example:

    # Wrong:
    nodes = [node for node in html if node != 'b' if node != 'i']
    
    # Correct:
    nodes = [node for node in html if node not in ('b', 'i')]
