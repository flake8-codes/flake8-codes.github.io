{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid if statements that simply return booleans in functions or
methods.

Reasoning: There is no need to test a condition and simply return a
boolean depending on its outcome if there is not going to be any
additional code.

Solution: Instead of testing the condition and returning a boolean,
return the condition itself. This applies to early returning ifs too.

Example::

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        return some_condition
    
    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        if some_condition:
            return True
        else:
            return False
