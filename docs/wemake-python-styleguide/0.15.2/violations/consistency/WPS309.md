title: Found reversed compare order
---

Forbid comparisons where the argument doesn't come first.

## Reasoning
It is hard to read the code when you have to shuffle the ordering of
the arguments all the time. Bring consistency to the comparison\!

## Solution
Refactor your comparison expression, place the argument first.

Example:

    # Correct:
    if some_x > 3:
    if 3 < some_x < 10:
    
    # Wrong:
    if 3 < some_x:
