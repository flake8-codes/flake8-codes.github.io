Forbid extra indentation.

## Reasoning
You can use extra indentation for lines of code. Python allows you
to do that in case you want to keep the indentation level equal for
this specific node, but that's insane\!

## Solution
We should stick to 4 spaces for an indentation block. Each next
block level should be indented by just 4 extra spaces.

Example:

    # Correct:
    def test():
        print('test')
    
    # Wrong:
    def test():
                print('test')

This rule is consistent with the "Vertical Hanging Indent" option for
`multi_line_output` setting of `isort`. To avoid conflicting rules, you
should set `multi_line_output = 3` in the `isort` settings.
