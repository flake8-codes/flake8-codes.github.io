title: Found constant compare
---

Forbids to have compares between two literals.

## Reasoning
When two constants are compared it is typically an indication of a
mistake, since the Boolean value of the compare, will always be the
same.

## Solution
Remove the constant compare and any associated dead code.

## Example

    # Wrong:
    if 60 * 60 < 1000:
        do_something()
    else:
        do_something_else()
    
    # Correct:
    do_something_else()
