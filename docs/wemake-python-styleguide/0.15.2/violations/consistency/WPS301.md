{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid imports like `import os.path`.

  - Reasoning:  
    There are too many ways to import something. We should pick one
    style and stick to it. We have decided to use the readable one.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your import statement.

Example:

    # Correct:
    from os import path
    
    # Wrong:
    import os.path
