title: Found implicit `elif` condition

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid implicit `elif` conditions.

Reasoning: Nested `if` in `else` cases are bad for readability because
of the nesting level.

Solution: Use `elif` on the same level.

Example::

    # Correct:
    if some:
        ...
    elif other:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    if some:
        ...
    else:
        if other:
            ...
