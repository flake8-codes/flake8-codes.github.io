title: 'Found too many await expressions: _'
---

Forbids placing too many `await` expressions into a function.

## Reasoning
When there are too many `await` keywords, functions are starting to
get really complex. It is hard to tell where are we and what is
going on.

## Solution
Change your design. Split functions into multiple ones.

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-awaits`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_AWAITS') }}
