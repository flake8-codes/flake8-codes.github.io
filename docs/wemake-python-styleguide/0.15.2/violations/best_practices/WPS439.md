title: 'Found unicode escape in a binary string: _'
---

Forbid Unicode escape sequences in binary strings.

## Reasoning
Binary strings do not work with Unicode. Having Unicode escape
characters in there means that you have an error in your code.

## Solution
Use regular strings when escaping Unicode strings.

## Example

    # Correct:
    escaped = '\u0041'  # equals to 'A'
    
    # Wrong:
    escaped = b'\u0040'  # equals to b'\\u0040'
