title: Found descriptor applied on a function
---


Forbids descriptors in regular functions.

Forbids using `@staticmethod`, ``@classmethod`` and ``@property`` for
functions not in class.

Reasoning:
    Descriptors like @staticmethod, @classmethod and @property do magic
    only as methods. We would want to warn users if the descriptors are
    used on regular functions.

Solution:
    Do not use @staticmethod, @classmethod and @property on regular
    functions or wrap the functions into a Class.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class TestClass(object):
        @property
        def my_method():
            ...

    # Wrong:
    @property
    def my_function():
        ...
