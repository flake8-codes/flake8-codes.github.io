title: Found wrong doc comment
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid empty doc comments (`#:`).

  - Reasoning:  
    Doc comments are used to provide documentation but supplying empty
    doc comments breaks this use-case. It is unclear why they can be
    used with no contents.

  - Solution:  
    Add some documentation to this comment or remove it.

Empty doc comments are not caught by the default `pycodestyle` checks.

Example:

    # Correct:
    #: List of allowed names:
    NAMES_WHITELIST = ['feature', 'bug', 'research']
    
    # Wrong:
    #:
    NAMES_WHITELIST = ['feature', 'bug', 'research']
