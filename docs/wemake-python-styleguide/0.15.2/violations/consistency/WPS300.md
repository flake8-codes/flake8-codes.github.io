title: Found local folder import

Forbid imports relative to the current folder.

## Reasoning
We should pick one style and stick to it. We have decided to use the
explicit one.

## Solution
Refactor your imports to use the absolute path.

## Example

    # Correct:
    from my_package.version import get_version
    
    # Wrong:
    from .version import get_version
    from ..drivers import MySQLDriver

<div class="versionadded">

0.1.0
