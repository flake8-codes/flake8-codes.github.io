Forbid too many classes and functions in a single module.

  - Reasoning:  
    Having many classes and functions in a single module is a bad thing.
    Soon it will be hard to read through this code and understand it.

  - Solution:  
    It is better to split this module into several modules or a package.

We do not make any distinctions between classes and functions in this
check. They are treated as the same unit of logic. We also do not care
about functions and classes being public or not. However, methods are
counted separately on a per-class basis.

  - Configuration:  
    This rule is configurable with `--max-module-members`. Default:
    {{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_MODULE_MEMBERS') }}
