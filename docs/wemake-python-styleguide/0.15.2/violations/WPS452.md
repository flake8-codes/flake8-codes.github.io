title: Found `break` or `continue` in `finally` block

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid `break` and `continue` in a `finally` block.

Related to {{ macros.wps_violation('TryExceptMultipleReturnPathViolation') }}.

  - Reasoning:  
    Putting any control statements in ``finally` is a terrible practice,
    because``finally\` is implicitly called and can cause damage to your
    logic with its implicitness. It should not be allowed.

  - Solution:  
    Remove `break` and `continue` from `finally` blocks.

Example:

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        break
    
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        continue
