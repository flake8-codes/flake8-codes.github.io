Forbids to import from already imported modules.

## Reasoning
Importing objects from already imported modules is inconsistent and
error-prone.

## Solution
Do not import objects from already imported modules or use aliases
when it cannot be avoided.

## Example

    # Correct:
    import public
    from public.module import FooClass
    
    import hypothesis
    from hypothesis import strategies as st
    
    # Wrong:
    from public import utils
    from public.utils import something
    
    import hypothesis
    from hypothesis import strategies
