title: Found "NaN" as argument to float()
---


Forbids using ``float("NaN")`` construct to generate NaN.

Reasoning:
    This method to generate NaN is really confusing and is a good way to
    catch a lot of unexpected bugs.

Solution:
    Even if you're 100% sure what you're doing, use ``math.nan`` instead.

Example::

    # Correct:
    min(math.nan, 3)

    # Wrong:
    min(float("NAN"), 3)
