title: 'Found too long name: _'

Forbids to have long short variable or module names.

## Reasoning
Too long names are unreadable. It is better to use shorter
alternative. Long names also indicate that this variable is too
complex, maybe it may require some documentation.

## Solution
Think of another name. Give less context to it.

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, methods,
and classes.

## Example

    # Correct:
    total_price = 25
    average_age = 45
    
    # Wrong:
    final_price_after_fifteen_percent_sales_tax_and_gratuity = 30
    total_age_of_all_participants_in_the_survey_divided_by_twelve = 2

## Configuration
This rule is configurable with `--max-name-length`. Default:
{{ wps.config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_NAME_LENGTH') }}
