Forbid ``u`` string prefix.

Reasoning:
    We haven't needed this prefix since ``python2``,
    but it is still possible to find it in a codebase.

Solution:
    Remove this prefix.

Example::

    # Correct:
    nickname = 'sobolevn'
    file_contents = b'aabbcc'

    # Wrong:
    nickname = u'sobolevn'
