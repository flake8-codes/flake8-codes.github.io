Restrict the maximum number of base classes.

Reasoning: It is almost never possible to navigate to the desired method
of a parent class when you need it with multiple mixins. It is hard to
understand `mro` and `super` calls. Do not overuse this technique.

Solution: Reduce the number of base classes. Use composition over
inheritance.

Example::

# Correct:

class SomeClassName(First, Second, Mixin): ...

# Wrong:

class SomeClassName( FirstParentClass, SecondParentClass,
ThirdParentClass, CustomClass, AddedClass, ): ...

Configuration: This rule is configurable with `--max-base-classes`.
Default:
{{ macros.wps_config('python://wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_BASE_CLASSES') }}
