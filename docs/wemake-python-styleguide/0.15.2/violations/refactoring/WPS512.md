title: Found isinstance call with a single element tuple
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid multiple `isinstance` calls with single-item tuples.

  - Reasoning:  
    There's no need to use tuples with single elements. You can use
    single variables or tuples with multiple elements.

  - Solution:  
    Use tuples with multiple elements or a single variable.

Example:

    # Correct:
    isinstance(some, (int, float))
    isinstance(some, int)
    
    # Wrong:
    isinstance(some, (int, ))
