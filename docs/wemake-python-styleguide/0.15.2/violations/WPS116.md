{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid using more than one consecutive underscore in variable names.

  - Reasoning:  
    This is done to gain extra readability. This naming rule already
    exists for module names.

Example:

    # Correct:
    some_value = 5
    __magic__ = 5
    
    # Wrong:
    some__value = 5

This rule checks: modules, variables, attributes, functions, and
methods.
