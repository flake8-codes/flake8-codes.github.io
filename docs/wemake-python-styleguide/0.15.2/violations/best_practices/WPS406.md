title: Found wrong context manager variable definition
---

Forbid anything other than `ast.Name` to define contexts.

  - Reasoning:  
    When defining a `with` context managers with attributes, indexes,
    calls, or any other nodes it does dirty things inside.

  - Solution:  
    Use regular `ast.Name` variables. Or tuple of `ast.Name` variables.
    Star names are also fine.

Example:

    # Correct:
    with open('README.md') as readme:
        ...
    
    # Wrong:
    with open('README.md') as files['readme']:
        ...
