Forbid consecutive ``yield`` expressions.

We raise this violation when we find at least
two consecutive ``yield`` expressions.

Reasoning:
    One can write multiple ``yield`` nodes in a row.
    That's inconsistent. Because we have ``yield from`` form.

Solution:
    It can be easily changed to ``yield from (...)`` format.
