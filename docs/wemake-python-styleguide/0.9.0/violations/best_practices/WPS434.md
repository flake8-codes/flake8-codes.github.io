title: 'Found using restricted magic method: _'
---

Forbids to use some magic methods.

## Reasoning
We forbid to use magic methods related to the forbidden language
parts. Likewise, we forbid to use `del` keyword, so we forbid to use
all magic methods related to it.

## Solution
Refactor your code to use custom methods instead. It will give more
context to your app.

See `MAGIC_METHODS_BLACKLIST` for
the full blacklist of the magic methods.
