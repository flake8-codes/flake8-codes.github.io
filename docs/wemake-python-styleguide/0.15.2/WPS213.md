title: 'Found too many expressions: {0}'
---


Forbid putting too many expressions in a single function.

This rule is quite similar to "max lines" in a function,
but is much nicer because we don't count lines,
we count real code entities. This way adding just several extra empty
lines for readability will never trigger this violation.

Related to :class:`~OverusedExpressionViolation`.

Reasoning:
    When there are too many expressions it means that this
    function does too many things at once. It has too much logic.

Solution:
    Split function into several functions, refactor your API.

Configuration:
    This rule is configurable with ``--max-expressions``.
    Default:
    :str:`wemake_python_styleguide.options.defaults.MAX_EXPRESSIONS`

.. versionadded:: 0.1.0
