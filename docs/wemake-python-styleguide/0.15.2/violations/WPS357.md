title: Found a ``\r`` (carriage return) line break
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid using `\r` (carriage return) in line breaks.

Reasoning: We enforce Unix-style newlines. We only use newlines (`\n`),
not carriage returns. So `\r` line breaks not allowed in code.

Solution: Use only `\n` (not `\r\n` or `\r`) to break lines.
