title: Found pointless starred expression
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbid useless starred expressions.

  - Reasoning:  
    Using starred expression with constants is useless. This piece of
    code can be rewritten to be flat. Eg.: `` `print(*[1, 2, 3]) `` is
    `` `print(1, 2, 3) ``.

  - Solution:  
    Refactor your code not to use starred expressions with `` `list ``,
    `` `dict ``, `` `tuple ``, and `` `set `` constants. Use regular
    argument passing instead.

Example:

    # Correct:
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, *other_iterable]
    
    # Wrong:
    print(*[1, 2, 3], **{{ '{{' }}}})
