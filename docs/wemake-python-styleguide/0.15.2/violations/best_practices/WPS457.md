title: Found an infinite while loop
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Forbids use of infinite `while True:` loops.

  - Reasoning:  
    Infinite loops will cause bugs in code.

  - Solution:  
    Add either a return, raise, or break to handle the infinite loop.

Example:

    # Correct:
    while True:
        print('forever')
        break
    
    # Wrong:
    while True:
        print('forever')
