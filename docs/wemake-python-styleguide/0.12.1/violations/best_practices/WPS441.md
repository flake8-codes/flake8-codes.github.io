title: 'Found control variable used after block: _'

Forbids to use control variables after the block body.

What we call block control variables:

1.  `for` loop unpacked variables
2.  `with` context variables
3.  `except` exception names

<!-- end list -->

## Reasoning
Variables leaking from the blocks can damage your logic. It might
not contain what you think they contain. Some variables even might
be deleted right after the block, just like in `except Exception as
exc:` where `exc` won't be in scope after `except` body.

## Solution
Use names inside the scope they are defined. Create new functions to
return values in case you need to use block variables: when
searching for a value, etc.

## Example

    # Correct:
    for my_item in collection:
        print(my_item)
    
    # Wrong:
    for my_item in collection:
        ...
    print(my_item)
