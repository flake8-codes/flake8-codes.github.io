Forbid naming variables `self`, `cls`, or `mcs`.

Reasoning: These names are special, they should only be used as first
arguments inside methods.

Example::

    # Correct:
    class Test(object):
        def __init__(self):
            ...
    
    # Wrong:
    cls = 5
    lambda self: self + 12

This rule checks: functions and methods. Having any reserved names in
`lambda` functions is not allowed.
