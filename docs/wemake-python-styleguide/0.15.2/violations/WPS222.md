Forbid conditions with too many logical operators.

We use :str:`wemake_python_styleguide.constants.MAX_CONDITIONS`
as a default value.

Reasoning:
    When reading through the complex conditions you will fail
    to understand all the possible branches. And you will end up putting
    debug breakpoint on this line just to figure out how it works.

Solution:
    We can reduce the complexity of a single ``if`` by doing two things:
    creating new variables or creating nested ``if`` statements.
    Both of these actions will trigger other complexity checks.

We count ``and`` and ``or`` keywords as conditions.
