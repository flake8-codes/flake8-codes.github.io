title: Found usable augmented assign pattern
---

{% import "macros.html" as macros with context %}

Enforce using augmented assign pattern.

  - Reasoning:  
    `` `a += b `` is short and correct version of `` `a = a + b ``. Why
    not using the short version?

Example:

    # Correct:
    a += b
    
    # Wrong:
    a = a + b
