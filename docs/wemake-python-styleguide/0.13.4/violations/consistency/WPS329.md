title: Found useless except case
---

Forbids to use meaningless `except` cases.

## Reasoning
Using `except` cases that just reraise the same exception is
error-prone. You can increase your stacktrace, silence some
potential exceptions, and screw things up. It also does not make any
sense to do so.

## Solution
Remove `except` case or make sure it makes sense.

## Example

    # Correct:
    try:
        ...
    except IndexError:
        sentry.log()
        raise ValueError()
    
    # Wrong:
    try:
        ...
    except TypeError:
        raise
