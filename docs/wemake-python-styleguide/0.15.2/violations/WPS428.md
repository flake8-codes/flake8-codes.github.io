Forbid statements that do nothing.

Reasoning:
    Statements that just access the value or expressions
    used as statements indicate that your code
    contains deadlines.
    They just pollute your codebase and do nothing.

Solution:
    Refactor your code in case it was a typo or error
    or just delete this code.

Example::

    # Correct:
    def some_function():
        price = 8 + 2
        return price

    # Wrong:
    def some_function():
        8 + 2
        print
